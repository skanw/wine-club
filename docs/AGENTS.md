## 🚀 8. Integration & Collaboration Guidelines

1. **Sprint Cadence**  
   - Sprints are **2 weeks**.  
   - Sprint Planning: Product Owner + Scrum Master + Development & UI/UX Agents.  
   - Daily Stand-ups: Brief updates from each agent on “What I did yesterday / Today / Blockers.”  
   - Sprint Review: Demo working features to stakeholders.  
   - Sprint Retrospective: Identify improvements for next sprint.

2. **Backlog & Task Tracking**  
   - All user stories and tasks live in a shared board (e.g., Notion or GitHub Issues).  
   - Each story must have:
     - Title: `[Feature-ID] Short Description`
     - Description: “As a … I want … so that …”
     - Acceptance Criteria: bullet points.  
   - Tasks are tagged with agent names (`@wineclub-developer`, `@wineclub-designer`, etc.).

3. **Communication Protocol**  
   - Use Cursor Chat threads for real-time discussion.  
   - When an agent completes a task, they post a summary comment and link to PR or artifact.  
   - If blocked, tag `@wineclub-scrum-master` immediately with a brief description.

4. **Definition of Done (DoD)**  
   - Code is merged to `main` branch with passing tests.  
   - QA Agent has signed off on acceptance criteria.  
   - UI/UX Designer confirms visual fidelity.  
   - DevOps has deployed to staging without errors.  
   - Product Owner has given final approval for feature release.

5. **Version Control & Branching**  
   - Feature branches: `feature/<story-id>-<short-name>`  
   - Bugfix branches: `bugfix/<ticket-id>-<short-name>`  
   - Release branches: `release/vX.Y.Z` (if needed)  
   - Pull Requests must reference the user story ID and include a checklist of DoD items.

Once loaded into Cursor, you can start a chat session with individual agents by referencing their names (e.g., `@wineclub-developer`) and assign them tasks as per the sprint backlog. 

Happy building! 🍷🚀
