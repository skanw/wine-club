# Project Vision

## Executive Snapshot

| Item | Summary |
|------|---------|
| **Problem** | Independent cavistes rely on POS + Excel + Mailchimp to run ad-hoc wine boxes. Processes are manual, stock visibility is poor, and subscribers churn because CX is inconsistent. |
| **Solution** | A cloud SaaS that plugs into the shop's POS (Square, Zettle, L'Addition) and adds: storefront & checkout, automated recurring billing, inventory & purchase-order tracking, shipping-label generation, and basic analytics. |
| **Beach-head market** | ~6,000 French caves (INSEE NAF 4725Z) that already hold Licence III/IV and sell premium "selection" wines curated by certified sommeliers. |
| **Why now** | 32% growth in caviste openings 2015-2022; post-Covid e-commerce adoption; POS subscriptions already normalised at €20-79/mo but no all-in-one club tool exists. |
| **Business model** | SaaS subscription €49/mo (≤100 subscribers) → €99/mo (101-500) plus 0.8% GMV above €5k/month. Free 60-day trial. |
| **12-month success metric** | MVP live, 10 paying caves, ≥500 consumer subscriptions processed, €6k ARR, NPS > 40. |
| **Long-term vision** | After French proof-point, expand to Benelux/DE/ES, then add a marketplace for sommeliers to source small-batch wines, creating a data-moat around consumer taste profiles. |

## Market Sizing (France First)

| Tier | Units | Spend on club software p.a. | Revenue opportunity |
|------|-------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **TAM** – All French cavistes | 6,000 shops | €600-1,200 (blend of basic €49 & pro €99 plans) | €4-7M |
| **SAM** – Digitally-open cavistes in large cities (≈40%) | 2,400 | same | €1.6-2.9M |
| **SOM** (3 yrs) – 15% share | 360 | — | €0.3-0.5M ARR |

*TAM based on INSEE registry counts; pricing benchmarks from Tactill €39-79/mo & DreamWine €19.9/mo; Commerce7 winery SaaS $149/mo validates higher willingness to pay for club tooling.*

## Overview
The Wine Club platform is designed to address a critical gap in the boutique wine market: small-to-mid-sized wine producers struggle to launch, scale, and manage subscription offerings without significant technical or operational overhead. Our mission is to become the premier, turn-key subscription solution that elevates wine caves into global brands. By combining an intuitive, data-driven interface with end-to-end automation, we free producers to focus exclusively on crafting exceptional wines while we handle everything from recurring billing to personalized member experiences.

## Real Market Need
- **Fragmented Processes**: Many wine caves still rely on spreadsheets, manual invoicing, and disjointed mailing lists. This fragmentation leads to lost revenue, high churn, and limited customer insights.
- **Rising Subscription Demand**: Consumer appetite for curated, direct-to-door wine experiences is growing rapidly. However, only a small fraction of boutique producers have the tools to capitalize on this trend.
- **Data Blind Spots**: Without robust analytics, producers can't identify which varietals resonate, predict inventory shortages, or tailor marketing outreach. This gap results in overstocked cellars, wasted budgets, and missed opportunities.
- **Competitive Pressure**: Larger wineries and big-box retailers are launching subscription services with slick consumer experiences. Boutique caves need a platform that levels the playing field—offering equally seamless, personalized interactions at a fraction of the cost and setup time.

## Core Vision
1. **Seamless Onboarding**  
   Allow any wine cave—regardless of size or technical expertise—to launch a fully branded subscription portal in under 7 days.  
2. **End-to-End Automation**  
   Automate every manual step:  
   - Recurring billing with Stripe  
   - Dynamic inventory tracking and low-stock alerts  
   - Membership segmentation and personalized recommendations  
   - Automated order fulfillment integrations (courier and logistics partners)  
3. **Data-Driven Growth Engine**  
   Provide insights that empower producers to:  
   - Optimize box curation based on real-time sales and customer preferences  
   - Forecast demand and manage production schedules  
   - Run targeted marketing campaigns by segment (e.g., "loyal collector," "new subscriber")  
4. **Delightful Member Experience**  
   Deliver a consumer-centric interface with features like:  
   - Personalized tasting notes generated by AI sommelier  
   - Predictive pairing recommendations based on past purchases  
   - Exclusive early access to limited vintages and flash sales  
5. **Scalable, Secure, and Compliant**  
   Build on a cloud-native, multi-tenant architecture that guarantees:  
   - 99.9% uptime and automatic failover  
   - PCI-compliant payment processing  
   - GDPR and local data residency compliance  
   - Role-based access controls for cave-level administrators and distributors

## Target Audience
- **Primary**:  
  - Independent wine caves (1–50 employees) seeking to transform occasional customers into stable, recurring revenue.  
  - Growers and co-ops that need to launch a subscription channel without hiring developers.
- **Secondary**:  
  - Wine enthusiasts looking for curated, personalized experiences—both locally and internationally.  
  - Luxury hospitality partners (hotel concierge, fine-dining restaurants) offering premium wine subscriptions as value-add.

## Financial Model (Bootstrap Scenario)

| Year | Cavistes EoY | Subscribers managed | ARR (€k) | Cash in (-out) | Headcount |
|------|--------------|-------------------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| **2025** (3m) | 3 pilot (free) | 150 | 0 | -1k (hosting, transport) | 1 |
| **2026** | 40 paying | 2,000 | 24 | -5k → +6k cash-flow* | 1 + freelancer |
| **2027** | 120 | 7,000 | 78 | reinvest 35k (support hire) | 3 |
| **2028** | 300 | 18,000 | 208 | +110k | 6 |

*Assumes €300 CAC (events/content), paid gradually; GMV fee adds 15% to revenue from year 2.*

**Break-even at ≈35 paying cavistes.**

## Funding Path
- **Pre-seed** (€50-75k friends/FFF or BPI France Innov) – Q4 2025
  - Use: POS connectors, pilot ops, legal.
- **Seed** (€400-600k BAs / Seed VC) – Q3 2026 after 40 paying cavistes & €2k MRR
  - Use: hire 2 engineers, 1 customer success, expand to Lille/Nice.
- **Series A** (€2-3M) – late 2027
  - Trigger: €75-100k ARR, <5% churn, POS integrations across EU; scale to Benelux/Spain, launch consumer app.

## Success Metrics
- **MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)**: €100K+ by end of 2027.  
- **Subscriber Retention**: ≥ 90% annual retention across partner caves.  
- **Time to Onboard**: Average cave goes live in ≤ 7 days.  
- **Partner Satisfaction**: Net Promoter Score (NPS) ≥ 50.  
- **Platform Reliability**: 99.9% uptime, < 0.1% critical errors.

## Regulatory & Risk Mitigation

| Issue | Mitigation |
|-------|------------|
| **Alcohol compliance** | Caviste already licensed; platform embeds age-check & blocks out-of-scope départements. |
| **Data protection (GDPR)** | Host in EU (Scaleway/Fly.io Paris), DPA with Stripe. |
| **Thin founder bench** | Scope MVP to POS & billing only; outsource UI polish to €25/hr freelancer. |
| **Cash burn** | Hosting ~€50/mo; Stripe Identity €1/verification; founder sweat-equity; first revenue by month 4. |

## Competitive Differentiators
- **Turn-Key Simplicity**: Go-live in days, not months—no development team needed.  
- **Deep Wine-Focus**: Every feature is crafted specifically for boutique wine operations (versus generic subscription platforms).  
- **AI-Enhanced Personalization**: Use tasting notes, past orders, and external ratings to curate boxes automatically.  
- **Global Scalability**: Multi-currency, multi-language support with built-in compliance for cross-border shipping.

## Immediate Next Steps (0-90 days)
1. Choose tech stack & build Stripe + Square POC (1–2 weeks).
2. Draft onboarding checklist (CSV template, POS connector instructions).
3. Book meetings with 5 target cavistes identified through Fédération directory; secure two LOIs contingent on demo.
4. Apply for BPI-FrenchTech "Bourse Création" grant (€30k non-dilutive).
5. Set up landing page collecting wait-list; run €100 Google Ads test on "logiciel abonnement caviste".

## Long-Term Vision
By 2028, Wine Club will be the de facto subscription SaaS for all premium producers across Europe and North America. Through strategic partnerships with logistics, marketing, and hospitality networks, we will expand into a family of "Curated Craft Clubs"—serving not only wine but also beer, cheese, chocolate, and bespoke gourmet selections—while continuously raising the bar for quality, personalization, and operational efficiency.
