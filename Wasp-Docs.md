# Getting Started

## Introduction

<HiddenLLMHelper />

:::note
If you are looking for the installation instructions, check out the [Quick Start](./quick-start.md) section.
:::

We will give a brief overview of what Wasp is, how it works on a high level and when to use it.

### Wasp is a tool to build modern web applications

It is an opinionated way of building **full-stack web applications**. It takes care of all three
major parts of a web application: **client** (front-end), **server** (back-end) and **database**.

#### Works well with your existing stack

Wasp is not trying to do everything at once but rather focuses on the complexity that arises from connecting all the parts of the stack (client, server, database, deployment).

Wasp is using **React**, **Node.js** and **Prisma** under the hood and relies on them to define web components and server queries and actions.

#### Wasp's secret sauce

At the core is the Wasp compiler which takes the Wasp config and your Javascript code and outputs the client app, server app and deployment code.

<ImgWithCaption source="/img/lp/wasp-compilation-diagram.png" caption="How the magic happens 🌈" />

The cool thing about having a compiler that understands your code is that it can do a lot of things for you.

Define your app in the Wasp config and get:

- login and signup with Auth UI components,
- full-stack type safety,
- e-mail sending,
- async processing jobs,
- React Query powered data fetching,
- security best practices,
- and more.

You don't need to write any code for these features, Wasp will take care of it for you 🤯 And what's even better, Wasp also maintains the code for you, so you don't have to worry about keeping up with the latest security best practices. As Wasp updates, so does your app.

### So what does the code look like?

Let's say you want to build a web app that allows users to **create and share their favorite recipes**.

Let's start with the `main.wasp` file: it is the central file of your app, where you describe the app from the high level.

Let's give our app a title and let's immediately turn on the full-stack authentication via username and password:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app RecipeApp {
  title: "My Recipes",
  wasp: { version: "{latestWaspVersion}" },
  auth: {
    methods: { usernameAndPassword: {} },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login",
    userEntity: User
  }
}
```

Let's then add the data models for your recipes. Wasp understands and uses the models from the `schema.prisma` file. We will want to have Users and Users can own Recipes:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
...

// Data models are defined using Prisma Schema Language.
model User {
  id          Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  recipes     Recipe[]
}

model Recipe {
  id          Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  title       String
  description String?
  userId      Int
  user        User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```

Next, let's define how to do something with these data models!

We do that by defining Operations, in this case, a Query `getRecipes` and Action `addRecipe`,
which are in their essence Node.js functions that execute on the server and can, thanks to Wasp, very easily be called from the client.

First, we define these Operations in our `main.wasp` file, so Wasp knows about them and can "beef them up":

```wasp title="main.wasp"
// Queries have automatic cache invalidation and are type-safe.
query getRecipes {
  fn: import { getRecipes } from "@src/recipe/operations",
  entities: [Recipe],
}

// Actions are type-safe and can be used to perform side-effects.
action addRecipe {
  fn: import { addRecipe } from "@src/recipe/operations",
  entities: [Recipe],
}
```

... and then implement them in our Javascript (or TypeScript) code (we show just the query here, using TypeScript):

```ts title="src/recipe/operations.ts"
// Wasp generates the types for you.

export const getRecipes: GetRecipes<{}, Recipe[]> = async (_args, context) => {
  return context.entities.Recipe.findMany( // Prisma query
    { where: { user: { id: context.user.id } } }
  );
};

export const addRecipe ...
```

Now we can very easily use these in our React components!

For the end, let's create a home page of our app.

First, we define it in `main.wasp`:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
...

route HomeRoute { path: "/", to: HomePage }
page HomePage {
  component: import { HomePage } from "@src/pages/HomePage",
  authRequired: true // Will send user to /login if not authenticated.
}
```

and then implement it as a React component in JS/TS (that calls the Operations we previously defined):

```tsx title="src/pages/HomePage.tsx"

export function HomePage({ user }: { user: User }) {
  // Due to full-stack type safety, `recipes` will be of type `Recipe[]` here.
  const { data: recipes, isLoading } = useQuery(getRecipes) // Calling our query here!

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Recipes</h1>
      <ul>
        {recipes
          ? recipes.map((recipe) => (
              <li key={recipe.id}>
                <div>{recipe.title}</div>
                <div>{recipe.description}</div>
              </li>
            ))
          : 'No recipes defined yet!'}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

And voila! We are listing all the recipes in our app 🎉

This was just a quick example to give you a taste of what Wasp is. For step by step tour through the most important Wasp features, check out the [Todo app tutorial](../tutorial/01-create.md).

:::note
Above we skipped defining `/login` and `/signup` pages to keep the example a bit shorter, but those are very simple to do by using Wasp's Auth UI feature.
:::

### When to use Wasp

Wasp addresses the same core problems that typical web app frameworks are addressing, and it in big part [looks, swims and quacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test) like a web app framework.

#### Best used for

- building full-stack web apps (like e.g. Airbnb or Asana)
- quickly starting a web app with industry best practices
- to be used alongside modern web dev stack (React and Node.js are currently supported)

#### Avoid using Wasp for

- building static/presentational websites
- to be used as a no-code solution
- to be a solve-it-all tool in a single language

### Wasp is a DSL

:::note
You don't need to know what a DSL is to use Wasp, but if you are curious, you can read more about it below.
:::

Wasp does not match typical expectations of a web app framework: it is not a set of libraries, it is instead a simple programming language that understands your code and can do a lot of things for you.

Wasp is a programming language, but a specific kind: it is specialized for a single purpose: **building modern web applications**. We call such languages _DS&#x4C;_&#x73; (Domain Specific Language).

Other examples of _DS&#x4C;_&#x73; that are often used today are e.g. _SQL_ for databases and _HTML_ for web page layouts.
The main advantage and reason why _DS&#x4C;_&#x73; exist is that they need to do only one task (e.g. database queries)
so they can do it well and provide the best possible experience for the developer.

The same idea stands behind Wasp - a language that will allow developers to **build modern web applications with 10x less code and less stack-specific knowledge**.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Welcome, new Waspeteer 🐝!

Let's create and run our first Wasp app in 3 short steps:

1. **To install Wasp on Linux / OSX / WSL (Windows), open your terminal and run:**

   ```shell
   curl -sSL https://get.wasp.sh/installer.sh | sh
   ```

   ℹ️ Wasp requires Node.js and will warn you if it is missing: check below for [more details](#requirements).

2. **Then, create a new app by running:**

   ```shell
   wasp new
   ```

3. **Finally, run the app:**

   ```shell
   cd <my-project-name>
   wasp start
   ```

That's it 🎉 You have successfully created and served a new full-stack web app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and Wasp is serving both frontend and backend for you.

    **Experiencing the 'Bad CPU type in executable' issue on a device with arm64 (Apple Silicon)?**
    Given that the wasp binary is built for x86 and not for arm64 (Apple Silicon), you'll need to install [Rosetta on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861) if you are using a Mac with Mx (M1, M2, ...). Rosetta is a translation process that enables users to run applications designed for x86 on arm64 (Apple Silicon). To install Rosetta, run the following command in your terminal

    ```bash
    softwareupdate --install-rosetta
    ```

    Once Rosetta is installed, you should be able to run Wasp without any issues.

  <TabItem value="win">
    With Wasp for Windows, we are almost there: Wasp is successfully compiling and running on Windows but there is a bug or two stopping it from fully working. Check it out [here](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/48) if you are interested in helping.

    In the meantime, the best way to start using Wasp on Windows is by using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Once you set up Ubuntu on WSL, just follow Linux instructions for installing Wasp. You can refer to this [article](https://wasp.sh/blog/2023/11/21/guide-windows-development-wasp-wsl) if you prefer a step by step guide to using Wasp in WSL environment. If you need further help, reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX) - we have some community members using WSL that might be able to help you.
    :::caution
    If you are using WSL2, make sure that your Wasp project is not on the Windows file system, but instead on the Linux file system. Otherwise, Wasp won't be able to detect file changes, due to the [issue in WSL2](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4739).
    :::
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="source">
    If the installer is not working for you or your OS is not supported, you can try building Wasp from the source.

    To install from source, you need to clone the [wasp repo](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp), install [Cabal](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started.html) on your machine and then run `cabal install` from the `waspc/` dir.

    If you have never built Wasp before, this might take some time due to `cabal` downloading dependencies for the first time.

    Check [waspc/](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/main/waspc) for more details on building Wasp from the source.

## Editor Setup

:::note
This page assumes you have already installed Wasp. If you do not have Wasp installed yet, check out the [Quick Start](./quick-start.md) guide.
:::

Wasp comes with the Wasp language server, which gives supported editors powerful support and integration with the language.

### VSCode

Currently, Wasp only supports integration with VSCode. Install the [Wasp language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wasp-lang.wasp) to get syntax highlighting and integration with the Wasp language server.

The extension enables:

- syntax highlighting for `.wasp` files
- the Prisma extension for `.prisma` files
- scaffolding of new project files
- code completion
- diagnostics (errors and warnings)
- go to definition

and more!

# Tutorial

## 1. Creating a New Project

:::info
You'll need to have the latest version of Wasp installed locally to follow this tutorial. If you haven't installed it yet, check out the [QuickStart](../quick-start) guide!
:::

In this section, we'll guide you through the process of creating a simple Todo app with Wasp. In the process, we'll take you through the most important and useful features of Wasp.

<img alt="How Todo App will work once it is done" src={useBaseUrl('img/todo-app-tutorial-intro.gif')} className="tutorial-image" />

<br />

<br />

If you get stuck at any point (or just want to chat), reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX) and we will help you!

You can find the complete code of the app we're about to build [here](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/release/examples/tutorials/TodoApp).

### Creating a Project

To setup a new Wasp project, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
wasp new TodoApp -t minimal
```

<small>

We are using the `minimal` template because we're going to implement the app from scratch, instead of the more full-featured default template.
</small>

Enter the newly created directory and start the development server:

```sh
cd TodoApp
wasp start
```

`wasp start` will take a bit of time to start the server the first time you run it in a new project.

You will see log messages from the client, server, and database setting themselves up. When everything is ready, a new tab should open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` with a simple placeholder page:

<img alt="Screenshot of the Wasp minimal starter app" src={useBaseUrl('img/wasp-new-screenshot.png')} className="tutorial-image" />

<br />

<br />

Wasp has generated for you the full front-end and back-end code of the app! Next, we'll take a closer look at how the project is structured.

### A note on supported languages

Wasp supports both JavaScript and TypeScript out of the box, but you are free to choose between or mix JavaScript and TypeScript as you see fit.

We'll provide you with both JavaScript and TypeScript code in this tutorial.
Code blocks will have a toggle to switch between vanilla JavaScript and TypeScript.

Try it out:

    :::
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 2. Project Structure

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    By default, Wasp will create a TypeScript project. We recommend using TypeScript in new projects, and you can always mix-and-match TypeScript and JavaScript files.
    
    To use JavaScript in the main page, you must manually rename the file
    `src/MainPage.tsx` to `src/MainPage.jsx`. Restart `wasp start` after you do this.

    No updates to the `main.wasp` file are necessary - it stays the same regardless of the language you use.

    After creating a new Wasp project and renaming the `src/MainPage.tsx` file, your project should look like this:

    <!-- NOTE: Using python as language to get syntax highlighting for the comments -->
    ```python
    .
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── main.wasp     # Your Wasp code goes here.
    ├── schema.prisma # Your database models go here.
    ├── package.json  # Your dependencies and project info go here.
    ├── public        # Your static files (e.g., images, favicon) go here.
    │   └── favicon.ico
    ├── src           # Your source code (JS/React/Node.js) goes here.
    │   ├── Main.css
    # highlight-next-line
    │   ├── MainPage.jsx
    │   ├── assets
    │   │   └── logo.svg
    │   └── vite-env.d.ts
    ├── tsconfig.json
    └── vite.config.ts
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    After creating a new Wasp project, your project should look like this:

    ```python
    .
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── main.wasp     # Your Wasp code goes here.
    ├── schema.prisma # Your database models go here.
    ├── package.json  # Your dependencies and project info go here.
    ├── public        # Your static files (e.g., images, favicon) go here.
    │   └── favicon.ico
    ├── src           # Your source code (TS/React/Node.js) goes here.
    │   ├── Main.css
    │   ├── MainPage.tsx
    │   ├── assets
    │   │   └── logo.svg
    │   └── vite-env.d.ts
    ├── tsconfig.json
    └── vite.config.ts
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

By _your code_, we mean the _"the code you write"_, as opposed to the code generated by Wasp. Wasp allows you to organize and structure your code however you think is best - there's no need to separate client files and server files into different directories.

We'd normally recommend organizing code by features (i.e., vertically).
However, since this tutorial contains only a handful of files, there's no need for fancy organization.
We'll keep it simple by placing everything in the root `src` directory.

Many other files (e.g., `tsconfig.json`, `vite-env.d.ts`, `.wasproot`, etc.) help Wasp and the IDE improve your development experience with autocompletion, IntelliSense, and error reporting.

The `vite.config.ts` file is used to configure [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/), Wasp's build tool of choice.
We won't be configuring Vite in this tutorial, so you can safely ignore the file. Still, if you ever end up wanting more control over Vite, you'll find everything you need to know in [custom Vite config docs](../project/custom-vite-config.md).

The `schema.prisma` file is where you define your database schema using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/). We'll cover this a bit later in the tutorial.

The most important file in the project is `main.wasp`. Wasp uses the configuration within it to perform its magic. Based on what you write, it generates a bunch of code for your database, server-client communication, React routing, and more.

Let's take a closer look at `main.wasp`

### `main.wasp`

`main.wasp` is your app's definition file.
It defines the app's central components and helps Wasp to do a lot of the legwork for you.

:::tip Wasp TS config \[Early-preview feature\]
If you wish, you can alternatively define your [Wasp config in TS](../general/wasp-ts-config.md) (`main.wasp.ts`) instead of `main.wasp`.
:::

The file is a list of _declarations_. Each declaration defines a part of your app.

The default `main.wasp` file generated with `wasp new` on the previous page looks like this:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app TodoApp {
      wasp: {
        version: "{latestWaspVersion}" // Pins the version of Wasp to use.
      },
      title: "TodoApp", // Used as the browser tab title. Note that all strings in Wasp are double quoted!
      head: [
        "<link rel='icon' href='/favicon.ico' />",
      ]
    }

    route RootRoute { path: "/", to: MainPage }
    page MainPage {
      // We specify that the React implementation of the page is exported from
      // `src/MainPage.jsx`. This statement uses standard JS import syntax.
      // Use `@src` to reference files inside the `src` folder.
      component: import { MainPage } from "@src/MainPage"
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app TodoApp {
      wasp: {
        version: "{latestWaspVersion}" // Pins the version of Wasp to use.
      },
      title: "TodoApp", // Used as the browser tab title. Note that all strings in Wasp are double quoted!
      head: [
        "<link rel='icon' href='/favicon.ico' />",
      ]
    }

    route RootRoute { path: "/", to: MainPage }
    page MainPage {
      // We specify that the React implementation of the page is exported from
      // `src/MainPage.tsx`. This statement uses standard JS import syntax.
      // Use `@src` to reference files inside the `src` folder.
      component: import { MainPage } from "@src/MainPage"
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This file uses three declaration types:

- **app**: Top-level configuration information about your app.

- **route**: Describes which path each page should be accessible from.

- **page**: Defines a web page and the React component that gets rendered when the page is loaded.

In the next section, we'll explore how **route** and **page** work together to build your web app.

## 3. Pages & Routes

In the default `main.wasp` file created by `wasp new`, there is a **page** and a **route** declaration:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    route RootRoute { path: "/", to: MainPage }
    page MainPage {
      // We specify that the React implementation of the page is exported from
      // `src/MainPage.jsx`. This statement uses standard JS import syntax.
      // Use `@src` to reference files inside the `src` folder.
      component: import { MainPage } from "@src/MainPage"
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    route RootRoute { path: "/", to: MainPage }
    page MainPage {
      // We specify that the React implementation of the page is exported from
      // `src/MainPage.tsx`. This statement uses standard JS import syntax.
      // Use `@src` to reference files inside the `src` folder.
      component: import { MainPage } from "@src/MainPage"
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Together, these declarations tell Wasp that when a user navigates to `/`, it should render the named export from `src/MainPage.{jsx,tsx}`.

### The MainPage Component

Let's take a look at the React component referenced by the page declaration:

```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx" auto-js

export function MainPage() {
  // ...
}
```

This is a regular functional React component. It also imports some CSS and a logo from the `assets` folder.

That is all the code you need! Wasp takes care of everything else necessary to define, build, and run the web app.

<WaspStartNote />

<ShowForTs>
  <TypescriptServerNote />
</ShowForTs>

### Adding a Second Page

To add more pages, you can create another set of **page** and **route** declarations. You can even add parameters to the URL path, using the same syntax as [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/6.26.1). Let's test this out by adding a new page:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
route HelloRoute { path: "/hello/:name", to: HelloPage }
page HelloPage {
  component: import { HelloPage } from "@src/HelloPage"
}
```

When a user visits `/hello/their-name`, Wasp renders the component exported from `src/HelloPage.{jsx,tsx}` and you can use the `useParams` hook from `react-router-dom` to access the `name` parameter:

```tsx title="src/HelloPage.tsx" auto-js

export const HelloPage = () => {
  const { name } = useParams<'name'>()
  return <div>Here's {name}!</div>
}
```

Now you can visit `/hello/johnny` and see "Here's johnny!"

<ShowForTs>
  :::tip Type-safe links
  Since you are using Typescript, you can benefit from using Wasp's type-safe `Link` component and the `routes` object. Check out the [type-safe links docs](../advanced/links) for more details.
  :::
</ShowForTs>

### Cleaning Up

Now that you've seen how Wasp deals with Routes and Pages, it's finally time to build the Todo app.

Start by cleaning up the starter project and removing unnecessary code and files.

First, remove most of the code from the `MainPage` component:

```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx" auto-js
export const MainPage = () => {
  return <div>Hello world!</div>
}
```

At this point, the main page should look like this:

<img alt="Todo App - Hello World" src={useBaseUrl('img/todo-app-hello-world.png')} className="tutorial-image" />

You can now delete redundant files: `src/Main.css`, `src/assets/logo.svg`, and `src/HelloPage.{jsx,tsx}` (we won't need this page for the rest of the tutorial).

Since `src/HelloPage.{jsx,tsx}` no longer exists, remove its `route` and `page` declarations from the `main.wasp` file.

Your Wasp file should now look like this:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app TodoApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "TodoApp",
  head: [
    "<link rel='icon' href='/favicon.ico' />",
  ]
}

route RootRoute { path: "/", to: MainPage }
page MainPage {
  component: import { MainPage } from "@src/MainPage"
}
```

Excellent work!

You now have a basic understanding of Wasp and are ready to start building your TodoApp.
We'll implement the app's core features in the following sections.

## 4. Database Entities

Entities are one of the most important concepts in Wasp and are how you define what gets stored in the database.

Wasp uses Prisma to talk to the database, and you define Entities by defining Prisma models in the `schema.prisma` file.

Since our Todo app is all about tasks, we'll define a Task entity by adding a Task model in the `schema.prisma` file:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
// ...

model Task {
    id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
    description String
    isDone      Boolean @default(false)
}
```

:::note
Read more about how Wasp Entities work in the [Entities](../data-model/entities.md) section or how Wasp uses the `schema.prisma` file in the [Prisma Schema File](../data-model/prisma-file.md) section.
:::

To update the database schema to include this entity, stop the `wasp start` process, if it's running, and run:

```sh
wasp db migrate-dev
```

You'll need to do this any time you change an entity's definition. It instructs Prisma to create a new database migration and apply it to the database.

To take a look at the database and the new `Task` entity, run:

```sh
wasp db studio
```

This will open a new page in your browser to view and edit the data in your database.

<img alt="Todo App - Db studio showing Task schema" src={useBaseUrl('img/todo-app-db-studio-task-entity.png')} className="tutorial-image" />

Click on the `Task` entity and check out its fields! We don't have any data in our database yet, but we are about to change that.

## 5. Querying the Database

We want to know which tasks we need to do, so let's list them!

The primary way of working with Entities in Wasp is with [Queries and Actions](../data-model/operations/overview), collectively known as **_Operations_**.

Queries are used to read an entity, while Actions are used to create, modify, and delete entities. Since we want to list the tasks, we'll want to use a Query.

To list the tasks, you must:

1. Create a Query that fetches the tasks from the database.
2. Update the `MainPage.{jsx,tsx}` to use that Query and display the results.

### Defining the Query

We'll create a new Query called `getTasks`. We'll need to declare the Query in the Wasp file and write its implementation in <ShowForJs>JS</ShowForJs><ShowForTs>TS</ShowForTs>.

#### Declaring a Query

We need to add a **query** declaration to `main.wasp` so that Wasp knows it exists:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    query getTasks {
      // Specifies where the implementation for the query function is.
      // The path `@src/queries` resolves to `src/queries.js`.
      // No need to specify an extension.
      fn: import { getTasks } from "@src/queries",
      // Tell Wasp that this query reads from the `Task` entity. Wasp will
      // automatically update the results of this query when tasks are modified.
      entities: [Task]
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    query getTasks {
      // Specifies where the implementation for the query function is.
      // The path `@src/queries` resolves to `src/queries.ts`.
      // No need to specify an extension.
      fn: import { getTasks } from "@src/queries",
      // Tell Wasp that this query reads from the `Task` entity. Wasp will
      // automatically update the results of this query when tasks are modified.
      entities: [Task]
    }
    ```

    :::note
    To generate the types used in the next section, make sure that `wasp start` is still running.
    :::
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Implementing a Query

<ShowForJs>
  Next, create a new file called `src/queries.js` and define the JavaScript function we've just imported in our `query` declaration:
</ShowForJs>

<ShowForTs>
  Next, create a new file called `src/queries.ts` and define the TypeScript function we've just imported in our `query` declaration:
</ShowForTs>

```ts title="src/queries.ts" auto-js

export const getTasks: GetTasks<void, Task[]> = async (args, context) => {
  return context.entities.Task.findMany({
    orderBy: { id: 'asc' },
  })
}
```

<ShowForTs>
Wasp automatically generates the types `GetTasks` and `Task` based on the contents of `main.wasp`:

- `Task` is a type corresponding to the `Task` entity you defined in `schema.prisma`.
- `GetTasks` is a generic type Wasp automatically generated based on the `getTasks` Query you defined in `main.wasp`.

You can use these types to specify the Query's input and output types. This Query doesn't expect any arguments (its input type is `void`), but it does return an array of tasks (its output type is `Task[]`).

Annotating the Queries is optional, but highly recommended because doing so enables **full-stack type safety**. We'll see what this means in the next step.
</ShowForTs>

Query function parameters:

- `args: object`

The arguments the caller passes to the Query.

- `context`

  An object with extra information injected by Wasp. Its type depends on the Query declaration.

Since the Query declaration in `main.wasp` says that the `getTasks` Query uses `Task` entity, Wasp injected a [Prisma client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/crud) for the `Task` entity as `context.entities.Task` - we used it above to fetch all the tasks from the database.

:::info
Queries and Actions are NodeJS functions executed on the server.
:::

### Invoking the Query On the Frontend

While we implement Queries on the server, Wasp generates client-side functions that automatically take care of serialization, network calls, and cache invalidation, allowing you to call the server code like it's a regular function.

This makes it easy for us to use the `getTasks` Query we just created in our React component:

```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx" auto-js

// highlight-next-line

export const MainPage = () => {
  // highlight-start
  const { data: tasks, isLoading, error } = useQuery(getTasks)

  return (
    <div>
      {tasks && <TasksList tasks={tasks} />}

      {isLoading && 'Loading...'}
      {error && 'Error: ' + error}
    </div>
  )
  // highlight-end
}

// highlight-start
const TaskView = ({ task }: { task: Task }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <input type="checkbox" id={String(task.id)} checked={task.isDone} />
      {task.description}
    </div>
  )
}

const TasksList = ({ tasks }: { tasks: Task[] }) => {
  if (!tasks?.length) return <div>No tasks</div>

  return (
    <div>
      {tasks.map((task, idx) => (
        <TaskView task={task} key={idx} />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
// highlight-end
```

Most of this code is regular React, the only exception being the <ShowForJs>two</ShowForJs><ShowForTs>three</ShowForTs> special `wasp` imports:

<ShowForJs>
  - `getTasks` - The client-side Query function Wasp generated based on the `getTasks` declaration in `main.wasp`.
  - `useQuery` - Wasp's [useQuery](../data-model/operations/queries#the-usequery-hook-1) React hook, which is based on [react-query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query)'s hook with the same name.
</ShowForJs>

<ShowForTs>
  - `getTasks` - The client-side Query function Wasp generated based on the `getTasks` declaration in `main.wasp`.
  - `useQuery` - Wasp's [useQuery](../data-model/operations/queries#the-usequery-hook-1) React hook, which is based on [react-query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query)'s hook with the same name.
  - `Task` - The type for the Task entity defined in `schema.prisma`.

  Notice how you don't need to annotate the type of the Query's return value: Wasp uses the types you defined while implementing the Query for the generated client-side function. This is **full-stack type safety**: the types on the client always match the types on the server.
</ShowForTs>

We could have called the Query directly using `getTasks()`, but the `useQuery` hook makes it reactive: React will re-render the component every time the Query changes. Remember that Wasp automatically refreshes Queries whenever the data is modified.

With these changes, you should be seeing the text "No tasks" on the screen:

<img alt="Todo App - No Tasks" src={useBaseUrl('img/todo-app-no-tasks.png')} className="tutorial-image" />

We'll create a form to add tasks in the next step 🪄

## 6. Modifying Data

In the previous section, you learned about using Queries to fetch data.
Let's now learn about Actions so you can add and update tasks in the database.

In this section, you will create:

1. A Wasp Action that creates a new task.
2. A React form that calls that Action when the user creates a task.

### Creating a New Action

Creating an Action is very similar to creating a Query.

#### Declaring an Action

We must first declare the Action in `main.wasp`:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
// ...

action createTask {
  fn: import { createTask } from "@src/actions",
  entities: [Task]
}
```

#### Implementing an Action

Let's now define a <ShowForJs>JavaScript</ShowForJs><ShowForTs>TypeScript</ShowForTs> function for our `createTask` Action:

```ts title="src/actions.ts" auto-js

type CreateTaskPayload = Pick<Task, 'description'>

export const createTask: CreateTask<CreateTaskPayload, Task> = async (
  args,
  context
) => {
  return context.entities.Task.create({
    data: { description: args.description },
  })
}
```

<ShowForTs>
Once again, we've annotated the Action with the `CreateTask` and `Task` types generated by Wasp. Just like with queries, defining the types on the implementation makes them available on the frontend, giving us **full-stack type safety**.
</ShowForTs>

:::tip
We put the function in a new file `src/actions.{js,ts}`, but we could have put it anywhere we wanted! There are no limitations here, as long as the declaration in the Wasp file imports it correctly and the file is located within `src` directory.
:::

### Invoking the Action on the Client

Start by defining a form for creating new tasks.

```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx" auto-js

  // highlight-next-line
  createTask,
  getTasks,
  useQuery
} from 'wasp/client/operations'

// ... MainPage, TaskView, TaskList ...

// highlight-start
const NewTaskForm = () => {
  const handleSubmit = async (event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    try {
      const target = event.target as HTMLFormElement
      const description = target.description.value
      target.reset()
      await createTask({ description })
    } catch (err: any) {
      window.alert('Error: ' + err.message)
    }
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input name="description" type="text" defaultValue="" />
      <input type="submit" value="Create task" />
    </form>
  )
}
// highlight-end
```

Unlike Queries, you can call Actions directly (without wrapping them in a hook) because they don't need reactivity. The rest is just regular React code.

<ShowForTs>
  Finally, because we've previously annotated the Action's server implementation with the correct type, Wasp knows that the `createTask` Action expects a value of type `{ description: string }` (try changing the argument and reading the error message). Wasp also knows that a call to the `createTask` Action returns a `Task` but are not using it in this example.
</ShowForTs>

All that's left now is adding this form to the page component:

```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx" auto-js

const MainPage = () => {
  const { data: tasks, isLoading, error } = useQuery(getTasks)

  return (
    <div>
      // highlight-next-line
      <NewTaskForm />
      {tasks && <TasksList tasks={tasks} />}
      {isLoading && 'Loading...'}
      {error && 'Error: ' + error}
    </div>
  )
}

// ... TaskList, TaskView, NewTaskForm ...
```

Great work!

You now have a form for creating new tasks.

Try creating a "Build a Todo App in Wasp" task and see it appear in the list below. The task is created on the server and saved in the database.

Try refreshing the page or opening it in another browser. You'll see the tasks are still there!

<img alt="Todo App - creating new task" src={useBaseUrl('img/todo-app-new-task.png')} className="tutorial-image" />

<br />

<br />

:::note Automatic Query Invalidation
When you create a new task, the list of tasks is automatically updated to display the new task, even though you haven't written any code that does that! Wasp handles these automatic updates under the hood.

When you declared the `getTasks` and `createTask` operations, you specified that they both use the `Task` entity. So when `createTask` is called, Wasp knows that the data `getTasks` fetches may have changed and automatically updates it in the background. This means that **out of the box, Wasp keeps all your queries in sync with any changes made through Actions**.

This behavior is convenient as a default but can cause poor performance in large apps. While there is no mechanism for overriding this behavior yet, it is something that we plan to include in Wasp in the future. This feature is tracked [here](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/63).
:::

### A Second Action

Our Todo app isn't finished if you can't mark a task as done.

We'll create a new Action to update a task's status and call it from React whenever a task's checkbox is toggled.

Since we've already created one task together, try to create this one yourself. It should be an Action named `updateTask` that receives the task's `id` and its `isDone` status. You can see our implementation below.

<Collapse title="Solution">
  Declaring the Action in `main.wasp`:

  ```wasp title="main.wasp"
  // ...

  action updateTask {
    fn: import { updateTask } from "@src/actions",
    entities: [Task]
  }
  ```

  Implementing the Action on the server:

  ```ts title="src/actions.ts" auto-js
  import type { CreateTask, UpdateTask } from 'wasp/server/operations'

  // ...

  type UpdateTaskPayload = Pick<Task, 'id' | 'isDone'>

  export const updateTask: UpdateTask<UpdateTaskPayload, Task> = async (
    { id, isDone },
    context
  ) => {
    return context.entities.Task.update({
      where: { id },
      data: {
        isDone: isDone,
      },
    })
  }
  ```
</Collapse>

You can now call `updateTask` from the React component:

```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx" auto-js

  // highlight-next-line
  updateTask,
  createTask,
  getTasks,
  useQuery,
} from 'wasp/client/operations'

// ... MainPage ...

const TaskView = ({ task }: { task: Task }) => {
  // highlight-start
  const handleIsDoneChange = async (event: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    try {
      await updateTask({
        id: task.id,
        isDone: event.target.checked,
      })
    } catch (error: any) {
      window.alert('Error while updating task: ' + error.message)
    }
  }
  // highlight-end

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        id={String(task.id)}
        checked={task.isDone}
        // highlight-next-line
        onChange={handleIsDoneChange}
      />
      {task.description}
    </div>
  )
}

// ... TaskList, NewTaskForm ...
```

Awesome!
You can now mark this task as done.

It's time to make one final addition to your app: supporting multiple users.

## 7. Adding Authentication

Most modern apps need a way to create and authenticate users. Wasp makes this as easy as possible with its first-class auth support.

To add users to your app, you must:

- [ ] Create a `User` Entity.
- [ ] Tell Wasp to use the _Username and Password_ authentication.
- [ ] Add login and signup pages.
- [ ] Update the main page to require authentication.
- [ ] Add a relation between `User` and `Task` entities.
- [ ] Modify your Queries and Actions so users can only see and modify their tasks.
- [ ] Add a logout button.

### Creating a User Entity

Since Wasp manages authentication, it will create [the auth related entities](../auth/entities) for you in the background. Nothing to do here!

You must only add the `User` Entity to keep track of who owns which tasks:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
// ...

model User {
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
}
```

### Adding Auth to the Project

Next, tell Wasp to use full-stack [authentication](../auth/overview):

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app TodoApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "TodoApp",
  head: [
    "<link rel='icon' href='/favicon.ico' />",
  ],
  // highlight-start
  auth: {
    // Tells Wasp which entity to use for storing users.
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      // Enable username and password auth.
      usernameAndPassword: {}
    },
    // We'll see how this is used in a bit.
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  }
  // highlight-end
}

// ...
```

Don't forget to update the database schema by running:

```sh
wasp db migrate-dev
```

By doing this, Wasp will create:

- [Auth UI](../auth/ui) with login and signup forms.
- A `logout()` action.
- A React hook `useAuth()`.
- `context.user` for use in Queries and Actions.

:::info
Wasp also supports authentication using [Google](../auth/social-auth/google), [GitHub](../auth/social-auth/github), and [email](../auth/email), with more on the way!
:::

### Adding Login and Signup Pages

Wasp creates the login and signup forms for us, but we still need to define the pages to display those forms on. We'll start by declaring the pages in the Wasp file:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
// ...

route SignupRoute { path: "/signup", to: SignupPage }
page SignupPage {
  component: import { SignupPage } from "@src/SignupPage"
}

route LoginRoute { path: "/login", to: LoginPage }
page LoginPage {
  component: import { LoginPage } from "@src/LoginPage"
}
```

Great, Wasp now knows these pages exist!

Here's the React code for the pages you've just imported:

```tsx title="src/LoginPage.tsx" auto-js

export const LoginPage = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ maxWidth: '400px', margin: '0 auto' }}>
      <LoginForm />
      <br />
      <span>
        I don't have an account yet (<Link to="/signup">go to signup</Link>).
      </span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The signup page is very similar to the login page:

```tsx title="src/SignupPage.tsx" auto-js

export const SignupPage = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ maxWidth: '400px', margin: '0 auto' }}>
      <SignupForm />
      <br />
      <span>
        I already have an account (<Link to="/login">go to login</Link>).
      </span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<ShowForTs>
  :::tip Type-safe links
  Since you are using Typescript, you can benefit from using Wasp's type-safe `Link` component and the `routes` object. Check out the [type-safe links docs](../advanced/links) for more details.
  :::
</ShowForTs>

### Update the Main Page to Require Auth

We don't want users who are not logged in to access the main page, because they won't be able to create any tasks. So let's make the page private by requiring the user to be logged in:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
// ...

page MainPage {
  // highlight-next-line
  authRequired: true,
  component: import { MainPage } from "@src/MainPage"
}
```

Now that auth is required for this page, unauthenticated users will be redirected to `/login`, as we specified with `app.auth.onAuthFailedRedirectTo`.

Additionally, when `authRequired` is `true`, the page's React component will be provided a `user` object as prop.

```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx" auto-js

// highlight-next-line
export const MainPage = ({ user }: { user: AuthUser }) => {
  // Do something with the user
  // ...
}
```

Ok, time to test this out. Navigate to the main page (`/`) of the app. You'll get redirected to `/login`, where you'll be asked to authenticate.

Since we just added users, you don't have an account yet. Go to the signup page and create one. You'll be sent back to the main page where you will now be able to see the TODO list!

Let's check out what the database looks like. Start the Prisma Studio:

```shell
wasp db studio
```

<img alt="Database demonstration - password hashing" src={useBaseUrl('img/wasp_user_in_db.gif')} className="tutorial-image" />

You'll notice that we now have a `User` entity in the database alongside the `Task` entity.

However, you will notice that if you try logging in as different users and creating some tasks, all users share the same tasks. That's because you haven't yet updated the queries and actions to have per-user tasks. Let's do that next.

<small>
  You might notice some extra Prisma models like `Auth`, `AuthIdentity` and `Session` that Wasp created for you. You don't need to care about these right now, but if you are curious, you can read more about them [here](../auth/entities).
</small>

### Defining a User-Task Relation

First, let's define a one-to-many relation between users and tasks (check the [Prisma docs on relations](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations)):

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
// ...

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  // highlight-next-line
  tasks Task[]
}

model Task {
  id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  description String
  isDone      Boolean @default(false)
  // highlight-next-line
  user        User?   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  // highlight-next-line
  userId      Int?
}
```

As always, you must migrate the database after changing the Entities:

```sh
wasp db migrate-dev
```

:::note
We made `user` and `userId` in `Task` optional (via `?`) because that allows us to keep the existing tasks, which don't have a user assigned, in the database.

This isn't recommended because it allows an unwanted state in the database (what is the purpose of the task not belonging to anybody?) and normally we would not make these fields optional.

Instead, we would do a data migration to take care of those tasks, even if it means just deleting them all. However, for this tutorial, for the sake of simplicity, we will stick with this.
:::

### Updating Operations to Check Authentication

Next, let's update the queries and actions to forbid access to non-authenticated users and to operate only on the currently logged-in user's tasks:

```ts title="src/queries.ts" auto-js

// highlight-next-line

export const getTasks: GetTasks<void, Task[]> = async (args, context) => {
  // highlight-start
  if (!context.user) {
    throw new HttpError(401)
  }
  // highlight-end
  return context.entities.Task.findMany({
    // highlight-next-line
    where: { user: { id: context.user.id } },
    orderBy: { id: 'asc' },
  })
}
```

```ts title="src/actions.ts" auto-js

// highlight-next-line

type CreateTaskPayload = Pick<Task, 'description'>

export const createTask: CreateTask<CreateTaskPayload, Task> = async (
  args,
  context
) => {
  // highlight-start
  if (!context.user) {
    throw new HttpError(401)
  }
  // highlight-end
  return context.entities.Task.create({
    data: {
      description: args.description,
      // highlight-next-line
      user: { connect: { id: context.user.id } },
    },
  })
}

type UpdateTaskPayload = Pick<Task, 'id' | 'isDone'>

export const updateTask: UpdateTask<
  UpdateTaskPayload,
  { count: number }
> = async (args, context) => {
  // highlight-start
  if (!context.user) {
    throw new HttpError(401)
  }
  // highlight-end
  return context.entities.Task.updateMany({
    where: { id: args.id, user: { id: context.user.id } },
    data: { isDone: args.isDone },
  })
}
```

:::note
Due to how Prisma works, we had to convert `update` to `updateMany` in `updateTask` action to be able to specify the user id in `where`.
:::

With these changes, each user should have a list of tasks that only they can see and edit.

Try playing around, adding a few users and some tasks for each of them. Then open the DB studio:

```sh
wasp db studio
```

<img alt="Database demonstration" src={useBaseUrl('img/wasp_db_demonstration.gif')} className="tutorial-image" />

You will see that each user has their tasks, just as we specified in our code!

### Logout Button

Last, but not least, let's add the logout functionality:

```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx" auto-js with-hole
// ...
// highlight-next-line

//...

const MainPage = () => {
  // ...
  return (
    <div>
      {$HOLE$}
      // highlight-next-line
      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This is it, we have a working authentication system, and our Todo app is multi-user!

### What's Next?

We did it 🎉 You've followed along with this tutorial to create a basic Todo app with Wasp.

# Data Model

## Entities

Entities are the foundation of your app's data model. In short, an Entity defines a model in your database.

Wasp uses the excellent [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) to implement all database functionality and occasionally enhances it with a thin abstraction layer. This means that you use the `schema.prisma` file to define your database models and relationships. Wasp understands the Prisma schema file and picks up all the models you define there. You can read more about this in the [Prisma Schema File](./prisma-file.md) section of the docs.

In your project, you'll find a `schema.prisma` file in the root directory:

```
.
├── main.wasp
...
├── schema.prisma
├── src
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

Prisma uses the _Prisma Schema Language_, a simple definition language explicitly created for defining models.
The language is declarative and very intuitive. We'll also go through an example later in the text, so there's no need to go and thoroughly learn it right away. Still, if you're curious, look no further than Prisma's official documentation:

- [Basic intro and examples](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/overview)
- [A more exhaustive language specification](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-schema-reference)

### Defining an Entity

A Prisma `model` declaration in the `schema.prisma` file represents a Wasp Entity.

<details>
  <summary>
    Entity vs Model
  </summary>

  You might wonder why we distinguish between a **Wasp Entity** and a **Prisma model** if they're essentially the same thing right now.

  While defining a Prisma model is currently the only way to create an Entity in Wasp, the Entity concept is a higher-level abstraction. We plan to expand on Entities in the future, both in terms of how you can define them and what you can do with them.

  So, think of an Entity as a Wasp concept and a model as a Prisma concept. For now, all Prisma models are Entities and vice versa, but this relationship might evolve as Wasp grows.
</details>

Here's how you could define an Entity that represents a Task:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```prisma title="schema.prisma"
    model Task {
      id          String  @id @default(uuid())
      description String
      isDone      Boolean @default(false)
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```prisma title="schema.prisma"
    model Task {
      id          String  @id @default(uuid())
      description String
      isDone      Boolean @default(false)
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The above Prisma `model` definition tells Wasp to create a table for storing Tasks where each task has three fields (i.e., the `tasks` table has three columns):

- `id` - A string value serving as a primary key. The database automatically generates it by generating a random unique ID.
- `description` - A string value for storing the task's description.
- `isDone` - A boolean value indicating the task's completion status. If you don't set it when creating a new task, the database sets it to `false` by default.

<ShowForTs>
  Wasp also exposes a type for working with the created Entity. You can import and use it like this:

  ```ts
  import { Task } from 'wasp/entities'

  const task: Task = { ... }

  // You can also define functions for working with entities
  function getInfoMessage(task: Task): string {
    const isDoneText = task.isDone ? "is done" : "is not done"
    return `Task '${task.description}' is ${isDoneText}.`
  }
  ```

  Using the `Task` type in `getInfoMessageInfo`'s definition connects the argument's type with the `Task` entity.

  This coupling removes duplication and ensures the function keeps the correct signature even if you change the entity. Of course, the function might throw type errors depending on how you change it, but that's precisely what you want!

  Entity types are available everywhere, including the client code:

  ```ts
  import { Task } from "wasp/entities"

  export function ExamplePage() {
    const task: Task = {
      id: 123,
      description: "Some random task",
      isDone: false,
    }
    return <div>{task.description}</div>
  }
  ```

  The mentioned type safety mechanisms also apply here: changing the task entity in our `schema.prisma` file changes the imported type, which might throw a type error and warn us that our task definition is outdated.

  You'll learn even more about Entity types when you start using [them with operations](#using-entities-in-operations).
</ShowForTs>

#### Working with Entities

Let's see how you can define and work with Wasp Entities:

1. Create/update some Entities in the `schema.prisma` file.
2. Run `wasp db migrate-dev`. This command syncs the database model with the Entity definitions the `schema.prisma` file. It does this by creating migration scripts.
3. Migration scripts are automatically placed in the `migrations/` folder. Make sure to commit this folder into version control.
4. Use Wasp's JavasScript API to work with the database when implementing Operations (we'll cover this in detail when we talk about [operations](../data-model/operations/overview)).

##### Using Entities in Operations

Most of the time, you will be working with Entities within the context of [Operations (Queries & Actions)](../data-model/operations/overview). We'll see how that's done on the next page.

##### Using Entities directly

If you need more control, you can directly interact with Entities by importing and using the [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/crud). We recommend sticking with conventional Wasp-provided mechanisms, only resorting to directly using the Prisma client only if you need a feature Wasp doesn't provide.

You can only use the Prisma Client in your Wasp server code. You can import it like this:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js
    import { prisma } from 'wasp/server'

    prisma.task.create({
        description: "Read the Entities doc",
        isDone: true // almost :)
    })
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts
    import { prisma } from 'wasp/server'

    prisma.task.create({
        description: "Read the Entities doc",
        isDone: true // almost :)
    })
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note Available Prisma features in the client

While the Prisma Client is not available in your client code, you can still import Prisma there, for accessing
type definitions (notably, `enum`s).

You can see more information in the overview of [supported Prisma Schema features](./prisma-file.md#the-enum-blocks).

:::

#### Next steps

Now that we've seen how to define Entities that represent Wasp's core data model, we'll see how to make the most of them in other parts of Wasp. Keep reading to learn all about Wasp Operations!

## Operations Overview

While Entities enable you to define your app's data model and relationships, Operations are all about working with this data.

There are two kinds of Operations: [Queries](../../data-model/operations/queries.md) and [Actions](../../data-model/operations/actions.md). As their names suggest,
Queries are meant for reading data, and Actions are meant for changing it (either by updating existing entries or creating new ones).

Keep reading to find out all there is to know about Operations in Wasp.

## Queries

We'll explain what Queries are and how to use them. If you're looking for a detailed API specification, skip ahead to the [API Reference](#api-reference).

You can use Queries to fetch data from the server. They shouldn't modify the server's state.
Fetching all comments on a blog post, a list of users that liked a video, information about a single product based on its ID... All of these are perfect use cases for a Query.

:::tip
Queries are fairly similar to Actions in terms of their API.
Therefore, if you're already familiar with Actions, you might find reading the entire guide repetitive.

We instead recommend skipping ahead and only reading [the differences between Queries and Actions](../../data-model/operations/actions#differences-between-queries-and-actions), and consulting the [API Reference](#api-reference) as needed.
:::

### Working with Queries

You declare queries in the `.wasp` file and implement them using NodeJS. Wasp not only runs these queries within the server's context but also creates code that enables you to call them from any part of your codebase, whether it's on the client or server side.

This means you don't have to build an HTTP API for your query, manage server-side request handling, or even deal with client-side response handling and caching.
Instead, just concentrate on implementing the business logic inside your query, and let Wasp handle the rest!

To create a Query, you must:

1. Declare the Query in Wasp using the `query` declaration.
2. Define the Query's NodeJS implementation.

After completing these two steps, you'll be able to use the Query from any point in your code.

#### Declaring Queries

To create a Query in Wasp, we begin with a `query` declaration.

Let's declare two Queries - one to fetch all tasks, and another to fetch tasks based on a filter, such as whether a task is done:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    query getAllTasks {
      fn: import { getAllTasks } from "@src/queries.js"
    }

    query getFilteredTasks {
      fn: import { getFilteredTasks } from "@src/queries.js"
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    query getAllTasks {
      fn: import { getAllTasks } from "@src/queries.js"
    }

    query getFilteredTasks {
      fn: import { getFilteredTasks } from "@src/queries.js"
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<small>
  If you want to know about all supported options for the `query` declaration, take a look at the [API Reference](#api-reference).
</small>

The names of Wasp Queries and their implementations don't need to match, but we'll keep them the same to avoid confusion.

:::info
You might have noticed that we told Wasp to import Query implementations that don't yet exist. Don't worry about that for now. We'll write the implementations imported from `queries.{js,ts}` in the next section.

It's a good idea to start with the high-level concept (the Query declaration in the Wasp file) and only then deal with the implementation details (the Query's implementation in JavaScript).
:::

After declaring a Wasp Query, two important things happen:

- Wasp **generates a server-side NodeJS function** that shares its name with the Query.

- Wasp **generates a client-side JavaScript function** that shares its name with the Query (e.g., `getFilteredTasks`).
  This function takes a single optional argument - an object containing any serializable data you wish to use inside the Query.
  Wasp will send this object over the network and pass it into the Query's implementation as its first positional argument (more on this when we look at the implementations).
  Such an abstraction works thanks to an HTTP API route handler Wasp generates on the server, which calls the Query's NodeJS implementation under the hood.

Generating these two functions ensures a similar calling interface across the entire app (both client and server).

#### Implementing Queries in Node

Now that we've declared the Query, what remains is to implement it.
We've instructed Wasp to look for the Queries' implementations in the file `src/queries.{js,ts}`, so that's where we should export them from.

Here's how you might implement the previously declared Queries `getAllTasks` and `getFilteredTasks`:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/queries.js"
    // our "database"
    const tasks = [
      { id: 1, description: 'Buy some eggs', isDone: true },
      { id: 2, description: 'Make an omelette', isDone: false },
      { id: 3, description: 'Eat breakfast', isDone: false },
    ]

    // You don't need to use the arguments if you don't need them
    export const getAllTasks = () => {
      return tasks
    }

    // The 'args' object is something sent by the caller (most often from the client)
    export const getFilteredTasks = (args) => {
      const { isDone } = args
      return tasks.filter((task) => task.isDone === isDone)
    }
    ```

    <SuperjsonNote />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/queries.ts"
    import { type GetAllTasks, type GetFilteredTasks } from 'wasp/server/operations'

    type Task = {
      id: number
      description: string
      isDone: boolean
    }

    // our "database"
    const tasks: Task[] = [
      { id: 1, description: 'Buy some eggs', isDone: true },
      { id: 2, description: 'Make an omelette', isDone: false },
      { id: 3, description: 'Eat breakfast', isDone: false },
    ]

    // You don't need to use the arguments if you don't need them
    export const getAllTasks: GetAllTasks<void, Task[]> = () => {
      return tasks
    }

    // The 'args' object is something sent by the caller (most often from the client)
    export const getFilteredTasks: GetFilteredTasks<
      Pick<Task, 'isDone'>,
      Task[]
    > = (args) => {
      const { isDone } = args
      return tasks.filter((task) => task.isDone === isDone)
    }
    ```

    <SuperjsonNote />

    #### Type support for Queries

    Wasp automatically generates the types `GetAllTasks` and `GetFilteredTasks` based on your Wasp file's declarations:

    - `GetAllTasks` is a generic type automatically generated by Wasp, based on the Query declaration for `getAllTasks`.
    - `GetFilteredTasks` is also a generic type automatically generated by Wasp, based on the Query declaration for `getFilteredTasks`.

    Use these types to type the Query's implementation.
    It's optional but very helpful since doing so properly types the Query's context.

    In this case, TypeScript will know the `context.entities` object must include the `Task` entity.
    TypeScript also knows whether the `context` object includes user information (it depends on whether your Query uses auth).

    The generated types are generic and accept two optional type arguments: `Input` and `Output`.

    1. `Input` - The argument (the payload) received by the Query function.
    2. `Output` - The Query function's return type.

    Use these type arguments to type the Query's inputs and outputs.

    <details>
      <summary>Explanation for the example above</summary>

      The above code says that the Query `getAllTasks` doesn't expect any arguments (its input type is `void`), but it does return a list of tasks (its output type is `Task[]`).

      On the other hand, the Query `getFilteredTasks` expects an object of type `{ isDone: boolean }`. This type is derived from the `Task` entity type.

      If you don't care about typing the Query's inputs and outputs, you can omit both type arguments. TypeScript will then infer the most general types (`never` for the input and `unknown` for the output).

      Specifying `Input` or `Output` is completely optional, but we highly recommended it. Doing so gives you:

      - Type support for the arguments and the return value inside the implementation.
      - **Full-stack type safety**. We'll explore what this means when we discuss calling the Query from the client.
    </details>

    Read more about type support for implementing Queries in the [API Reference](#implementing-queries).

    :::tip Inferring the return type

    If don't want to explicitly type the Query's return value, the `satisfies` keyword tells TypeScript to infer it automatically:

    ```typescript
    const getFoo = (async (_args, context) => {
      const foos = await context.entities.Foo.findMany()
      return {
        foos,
        message: 'Here are some foos!',
        queriedAt: new Date(),
      }
    }) satisfies GetFoo
    ```

    From the snippet above, TypeScript knows:

    1. The correct type for `context`.
    2. The Query's return type is `{ foos: Foo[], message: string, queriedAt: Date }`.

    If you don't need the context, you can skip specifying the Query's type (and arguments):

    ```typescript
    const getFoo = () => {{ name: 'Foo', date: new Date() }}
    ```

    :::

#### Using Queries

##### Using Queries on the client

To call a Query on the client, you can import it from `wasp/client/operations` and call it directly.

The usage doesn't change depending on whether the Query is authenticated or not.
Wasp authenticates the logged-in user in the background.

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js
    import { getAllTasks, getFilteredTasks } from 'wasp/client/operations'

    // ...

    const allTasks = await getAllTasks()
    const doneTasks = await getFilteredTasks({ isDone: true })
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts
    import { getAllTasks, getFilteredTasks } from 'wasp/client/operations'

    // TypeScript automatically infers the return values and type-checks
    // the payloads.
    const allTasks = await getAllTasks()
    const doneTasks = await getFilteredTasks({ isDone: true })
    ```

    Wasp supports **automatic full-stack type safety**.
    You only need to specify the Query's type in its server-side definition, and the client code will automatically know its API payload types.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

##### Using Queries on the server

Calling a Query on the server is similar to calling it on the client.

Here's what you have to do differently:

- Import Queries from `wasp/server/operations` instead of `wasp/client/operations`.
- Make sure you pass in a context object with the user to authenticated Queries.

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js
    import { getAllTasks, getFilteredTasks } from 'wasp/server/operations'

    const user = // Get an AuthUser object, e.g., from context.user in an operation.

    // ...

    const allTasks = await getAllTasks({ user })
    const doneTasks = await getFilteredTasks({ isDone: true }, { user })
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts
    import { getAllTasks, getFilteredTasks } from 'wasp/server/operations'

    const user = // Get an AuthUser object, e.g., from context.user in an operation.

    // TypeScript automatically infers the return values and type-checks
    // the payloads.
    const allTasks = await getAllTasks({ user })
    const doneTasks = await getFilteredTasks({ isDone: true }, { user })
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

##### The `useQuery` hook

When using Queries on the client, you can make them reactive with the `useQuery` hook.
This hook comes bundled with Wasp and is a thin wrapper around the `useQuery` hook from [_react-query_](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query). The only difference is that you don't need to supply the key - Wasp handles this for you automatically.

Here's an example of calling the Queries using the `useQuery` hook:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```jsx title="src/MainPage.jsx"
    import React from 'react'
    import { useQuery, getAllTasks, getFilteredTasks } from 'wasp/client/operations'

    const MainPage = () => {
      const { data: allTasks, error: error1 } = useQuery(getAllTasks)
      const { data: doneTasks, error: error2 } = useQuery(getFilteredTasks, {
        isDone: true,
      })

      if (error1 !== null || error2 !== null) {
        return <div>There was an error</div>
      }

      return (
        <div>
          <h2>All Tasks</h2>
          {allTasks && allTasks.length > 0
            ? allTasks.map((task) => <Task key={task.id} {...task} />)
            : 'No tasks'}

          <h2>Finished Tasks</h2>
          {doneTasks && doneTasks.length > 0
            ? doneTasks.map((task) => <Task key={task.id} {...task} />)
            : 'No finished tasks'}
        </div>
      )
    }

    const Task = ({ description, isDone }: Task) => {
      return (
        <div>
          <p>
            <strong>Description: </strong>
            {description}
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Is done: </strong>
            {isDone ? 'Yes' : 'No'}
          </p>
        </div>
      )
    }

    export default MainPage
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx"
    import React from 'react'
    import { type Task } from 'wasp/entities'
    import { useQuery, getAllTasks, getFilteredTasks } from 'wasp/client/operations'

    const MainPage = () => {
      // TypeScript automatically infers return values and type-checks payload types.
      const { data: allTasks, error: error1 } = useQuery(getAllTasks)
      const { data: doneTasks, error: error2 } = useQuery(getFilteredTasks, {
        isDone: true,
      })

      if (error1 !== null || error2 !== null) {
        return <div>There was an error</div>
      }

      return (
        <div>
          <h2>All Tasks</h2>
          {allTasks && allTasks.length > 0
            ? allTasks.map((task) => <Task key={task.id} {...task} />)
            : 'No tasks'}

          <h2>Finished Tasks</h2>
          {doneTasks && doneTasks.length > 0
            ? doneTasks.map((task) => <Task key={task.id} {...task} />)
            : 'No finished tasks'}
        </div>
      )
    }

    const Task = ({ description, isDone }: Task) => {
      return (
        <div>
          <p>
            <strong>Description: </strong>
            {description}
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Is done: </strong>
            {isDone ? 'Yes' : 'No'}
          </p>
        </div>
      )
    }

    export default MainPage
    ```

    Notice how you don't need to annotate the Query's return value type. Wasp automatically infers the from the Query's backend implementation. This is **full-stack type safety**: the types on the client always match the types on the server.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<small>
  For a detailed specification of the `useQuery` hook, check the [API Reference](#api-reference).
</small>

#### Error Handling

For security reasons, all exceptions thrown in the Query's NodeJS implementation are sent to the client as responses with the HTTP status code `500`, with all other details removed.
Hiding error details by default helps against accidentally leaking possibly sensitive information over the network.

If you do want to pass additional error information to the client, you can construct and throw an appropriate `HttpError` in your implementation:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/queries.js"
    import { HttpError } from 'wasp/server'

    export const getAllTasks = async (args, context) => {
      throw new HttpError(
        403, // status code
        "You can't do this!", // message
        { foo: 'bar' } // data
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/queries.ts"
    import { type GetAllTasks } from 'wasp/server/operations'
    import { HttpError } from 'wasp/server'

    export const getAllTasks: GetAllTasks = async (args, context) => {
      throw new HttpError(
        403, // status code
        "You can't do this!", // message
        { foo: 'bar' } // data
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If the status code is `4xx`, the client will receive a response object with the corresponding `message` and `data` fields, and it will rethrow the error (including these fields).
To prevent information leakage, the server won't forward these fields for any other HTTP status codes.

#### Using Entities in Queries

In most cases, resources used in Queries will be [Entities](../../data-model/entities.md).
To use an Entity in your Query, add it to the `query` declaration in Wasp:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp {4,9} title="main.wasp"

    query getAllTasks {
      fn: import { getAllTasks } from "@src/queries.js",
      entities: [Task]
    }

    query getFilteredTasks {
      fn: import { getFilteredTasks } from "@src/queries.js",
      entities: [Task]
    }

Wasp will inject the specified Entity into the Query's `context` argument, giving you access to the Entity's Prisma API:

The object `context.entities.Task` exposes `prisma.task` from [Prisma's CRUD API](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/crud).

### API Reference

#### Declaring Queries

The `query` declaration supports the following fields:

- `fn: ExtImport` Required!

  The import statement of the Query's NodeJs implementation.

- `entities: [Entity]`

  A list of entities you wish to use inside your Query.
  For instructions on using Entities in Queries, take a look at [the guide](#using-entities-in-queries).

##### Example

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    Declaring the Query:

    ```wasp
    query getFoo {
        fn: import { getFoo } from "@src/queries.js"
        entities: [Foo]
    }
    ```

    Enables you to import and use it anywhere in your code (on the server or the client):

    ```js
    // Use it on the client
    import { getFoo } from 'wasp/client/operations'

    // Use it on the server
    import { getFoo } from 'wasp/server/operations'
    ```

    On the client, the Query expects

    ```wasp
    query getFoo {
        fn: import { getFoo } from "@src/queries.js"
        entities: [Foo]
    }
    ```

    Enables you to import and use it anywhere in your code (on the server or the client):

    ```ts
    // Use it on the client
    import { getFoo } from 'wasp/client/operations'

    // Use it on the server
    import { getFoo } from 'wasp/server/operations'
    ```

    And also creates a type you can import on the server:

    ```ts
    import { type GetFoo } from 'wasp/server/operations'
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Implementing Queries

The Query's implementation is a NodeJS function that takes two arguments (it can be an `async` function if you need to use the `await` keyword).
Since both arguments are positional, you can name the parameters however you want, but we'll stick with `args` and `context`:

1. `args` (type depends on the Query)

   An object containing the data **passed in when calling the query** (e.g., filtering conditions).
   Check [the usage examples](#using-queries) to see how to pass this object to the Query.

2. `context` (type depends on the Query)

   An additional context object **passed into the Query by Wasp**. This object contains user session information, as well as information about entities. Check the [section about using entities in Queries](#using-entities-in-queries) to see how to use the entities field on the `context` object, or the [auth section](../../auth/overview#using-the-contextuser-object) to see how to use the `user` object.

<ShowForTs>
  After you [declare the query](#declaring-queries), Wasp generates a generic type you can use when defining its implementation.
  For the Query declared as `getSomething`, the generated type is called `GetSomething`:

  ```ts
  import { type GetSomething } from 'wasp/server/operations'
  ```

  It expects two (optional) type arguments:

  1. `Input`

     The type of the `args` object (the Query's input payload). The default value is `never`.

  2. `Output`

     The type of the Query's return value (the Query's output payload). The default value is `unknown`.

  The defaults were chosen to make the type signature as permissive as possible. If don't want your Query to take/return anything, use `void` as a type argument.
</ShowForTs>

##### Example

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    The following Query:

    ```wasp
    query getFoo {
        fn: import { getFoo } from "@src/queries.js"
        entities: [Foo]
    }
    ```

    Expects to find a named export `getFoo` from the file `src/queries.js`

    ```js title="queries.js"
    export const getFoo = (args, context) => {
      // implementation
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    The following Query:

    ```wasp
    query getFoo {
        fn: import { getFoo } from "@src/queries.js"
        entities: [Foo]
    }
    ```

    Expects to find a named export `getFoo` from the file `src/queries.js`

    You can use the generated type `GetFoo` and specify the Query's inputs and outputs using its type arguments.

    ```ts title="queries.ts"
    import { type GetFoo } from 'wasp/server/operations'

    type Foo = // ...

    export const getFoo: GetFoo<{ id: number }, Foo> = (args, context) => {
      // implementation
    };
    ```

    In this case, the Query expects to receive an object with an `id` field of type `number` (this is the type of `args`), and return a value of type `Foo` (this must match the type of the Query's return value).
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### The `useQuery` Hook

Wasp's `useQuery` hook is a thin wrapper around the `useQuery` hook from [_react-query_](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query).
One key difference is that Wasp doesn't expect you to supply the cache key - it takes care of it under the hood.

Wasp's `useQuery` hook accepts three arguments:

- `queryFn` Required!

  The client-side query function generated by Wasp based on a `query` declaration in your `.wasp` file.

- `queryFnArgs`

  The arguments object (payload) you wish to pass into the Query. The Query's NodeJS implementation will receive this object as its first positional argument.

- `options`

  A _react-query_ `options` object. Use this to change
  [the default
  behavior](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/important-defaults) for
  this particular Query. If you want to change the global defaults, you can do
  so in the [client setup function](../../project/client-config.md#overriding-default-behaviour-for-queries).

For an example of usage, check [this section](#the-usequery-hook).

## Actions

We'll explain what Actions are and how to use them. If you're looking for a detailed API specification, skip ahead to the [API Reference](#api-reference).

Actions are quite similar to [Queries](../../data-model/operations/queries.md), but with a key distinction: Actions are designed to modify and add data, while Queries are solely for reading data. Examples of Actions include adding a comment to a blog post, liking a video, or updating a product's price.

Actions and Queries work together to keep data caches up-to-date.

:::tip
Actions are almost identical to Queries in terms of their API.
Therefore, if you're already familiar with Queries, you might find reading the entire guide repetitive.

We instead recommend skipping ahead and only reading [the differences between Queries and Actions](#differences-between-queries-and-actions), and consulting the [API Reference](#api-reference) as needed.
:::

### Working with Actions

Actions are declared in Wasp and implemented in NodeJS. Wasp runs Actions within the server's context, but it also generates code that allows you to call them from anywhere in your code (either client or server) using the same interface.

This means you don't have to worry about building an HTTP API for the Action, managing server-side request handling, or even dealing with client-side response handling and caching.
Instead, just focus on developing the business logic inside your Action, and let Wasp handle the rest!

To create an Action, you need to:

1. Declare the Action in Wasp using the `action` declaration.
2. Implement the Action's NodeJS functionality.

Once these two steps are completed, you can use the Action from anywhere in your code.

#### Declaring Actions

To create an Action in Wasp, we begin with an `action` declaration. Let's declare two Actions - one for creating a task, and another for marking tasks as done:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    action createTask {
      fn: import { createTask } from "@src/actions.js"
    }

    action markTaskAsDone {
      fn: import { markTaskAsDone } from "@src/actions.js"
    }

    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    action createTask {
      fn: import { createTask } from "@src/actions.js"
    }

    action markTaskAsDone {
      fn: import { markTaskAsDone } from "@src/actions.js"
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<small>
  If you want to know about all supported options for the `action` declaration, take a look at the [API Reference](#api-reference).
</small>

The names of Wasp Actions and their implementations don't necessarily have to match. However, to avoid confusion, we'll keep them the same.

:::info
You might have noticed that we told Wasp to import Action implementations that don't yet exist. Don't worry about that for now. We'll write the implementations imported from `actions.{js,ts}` in the next section.

It's a good idea to start with the high-level concept (the Action declaration in the Wasp file) and only then deal with the implementation details (the Action's implementation in JavaScript).
:::

After declaring a Wasp Action, two important things happen:

- Wasp **generates a server-side NodeJS function** that shares its name with the Action.

- Wasp **generates a client-side JavaScript function** that shares its name with the Action (e.g., `markTaskAsDone`).
  This function takes a single optional argument - an object containing any serializable data you wish to use inside the Action.
  Wasp will send this object over the network and pass it into the Action's implementation as its first positional argument (more on this when we look at the implementations).
  Such an abstraction works thanks to an HTTP API route handler Wasp generates on the server, which calls the Action's NodeJS implementation under the hood.

Generating these two functions ensures a similar calling interface across the entire app (both client and server).

#### Implementing Actions in Node

Now that we've declared the Action, what remains is to implement it. We've instructed Wasp to look for the Actions' implementations in the file `src/actions.{js,ts}`, so that's where we should export them from.

Here's how you might implement the previously declared Actions `createTask` and `markTaskAsDone`:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/actions.js"
    // our "database"
    let nextId = 4
    const tasks = [
      { id: 1, description: 'Buy some eggs', isDone: true },
      { id: 2, description: 'Make an omelette', isDone: false },
      { id: 3, description: 'Eat breakfast', isDone: false },
    ]

    // You don't need to use the arguments if you don't need them
    export const createTask = (args) => {
      const newTask = {
        id: nextId,
        isDone: false,
        description: args.description,
      }
      nextId += 1
      tasks.push(newTask)
      return newTask
    }

    // The 'args' object is something sent by the caller (most often from the client)
    export const markTaskAsDone = (args) => {
      const task = tasks.find((task) => task.id === args.id)
      if (!task) {
        // We'll show how to properly handle such errors later
        return
      }
      task.isDone = true
    }
    ```

    <SuperjsonNote />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/actions.ts"
    import { type CreateTask, type MarkTaskAsDone } from 'wasp/server/operations'

    type Task = {
      id: number
      description: string
      isDone: boolean
    }

    // our "database"
    let nextId = 4
    const tasks = [
      { id: 1, description: 'Buy some eggs', isDone: true },
      { id: 2, description: 'Make an omelette', isDone: false },
      { id: 3, description: 'Eat breakfast', isDone: false },
    ]

    // You don't need to use the arguments if you don't need them
    export const createTask: CreateTask<Pick<Task, 'description'>, Task> = (
      args
    ) => {
      const newTask = {
        id: nextId,
        isDone: false,
        description: args.description,
      }
      nextId += 1
      tasks.push(newTask)
      return newTask
    }

    // The 'args' object is something sent by the caller (most often from the client)
    export const markTaskAsDone: MarkTaskAsDone<Pick<Task, 'id'>, void> = (
      args
    ) => {
      const task = tasks.find((task) => task.id === args.id)
      if (!task) {
        // We'll show how to properly handle such errors later
        return
      }
      task.isDone = true
    }
    ```

    <SuperjsonNote />

    #### Type support for Actions

    Wasp automatically generates the types `CreateTask` and `MarkTaskAsDone` based on the declarations in your Wasp file:

    - `CreateTask` is a generic type that Wasp automatically generated based on the Action declaration for `createTask`.
    - `MarkTaskAsDone` is a generic type that Wasp automatically generated based on the Action declaration for `markTaskAsDone`.

    Use these types to type the Action's implementation.
    It's optional but very helpful since doing so properly types the Action's context.

    In this case, TypeScript will know the `context.entities` object must include the `Task` entity.
    TypeScript also knows whether the `context` object includes user information (it depends on whether your Action uses auth).

    The generated types are generic and accept two optional type arguments: `Input` and `Output`.

    1. `Input` - The argument (the payload) received by the Action function.
    2. `Output` - The Action function's return type.

    Use these type arguments to type the Action's inputs and outputs.

    <details>
      <summary>Explanation for the example above</summary>

      The above code says that the Action `createTask` expects an object with the new task's description (its input type is `Pick<Task, 'description'>`) and returns the new task (its output type is `Task`).

      On the other hand, the Action `markTaskAsDone` expects an object of type `Pick<Task, 'id'>`. This type is derived from the `Task` entity type.

      If you don't care about typing the Action's inputs and outputs, you can omit both type arguments.
      TypeScript will then infer the most general types (`never` for the input and `unknown` for the output).

      Specifying `Input` or `Output` is completely optional, but we highly recommended it. Doing so gives you:

      - Type support for the arguments and the return value inside the implementation.
      - **Full-stack type safety**. We'll explore what this means when we discuss calling the Action from the client.
    </details>

    Read more about type support for implementing Actions in the [API Reference](#implementing-actions).

    :::tip Inferring the return type

    If don't want to explicitly type the Action's return value, the `satisfies` keyword tells TypeScript to infer it automatically:

    ```typescript
    const createFoo = (async (_args, context) => {
      const foo = await context.entities.Foo.create()
      return {
        newFoo: foo,
        message: "Here's your foo!",
        returnedAt: new Date(),
      }
    }) satisfies GetFoo
    ```

    From the snippet above, TypeScript knows:

    1. The correct type for `context`.
    2. The Action's return type is `{ newFoo: Foo, message: string, returnedAt: Date }`.

    If you don't need the context, you can skip specifying the Action's type (and arguments):

    ```typescript
    const createFoo = () => {{ name: 'Foo', date: new Date() }}
    ```

#### Using Actions

##### Using Actions on the client

To call an Action on the client, you can import it from `wasp/client/operations` and call it directly.

The usage doesn't depend on whether the Action is authenticated or not.
Wasp authenticates the logged-in user in the background.

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js
    import { createTask, markTaskAsDone } from 'wasp/client/operations'

    // ...

    const newTask = await createTask({ description: 'Learn TypeScript' })
    await markTaskAsDone({ id: 1 })
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts
    import { createTask, markTaskAsDone } from 'wasp/client/operations'

    // TypeScript automatically infers the return values and type-checks
    // the payloads.
    const newTask = await createTask({ description: 'Keep learning TypeScript' })
    await markTaskAsDone({ id: 1 })
    ```

    Wasp supports **automatic full-stack type safety**.
    You only need to specify the Action's type in its server-side definition, and the client code will automatically know its API payload types.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When using Actions on the client, you'll most likely want to use them inside a component:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```jsx title="src/pages/Task.jsx"
    import React from 'react'
    // highlight-next-line
    import { useQuery, getTask, markTaskAsDone } from 'wasp/client/operations'

    export const TaskPage = ({ id }) => {
      const { data: task } = useQuery(getTask, { id })

      if (!task) {
        return <h1>"Loading"</h1>
      }

      const { description, isDone } = task
      return (
        <div>
          <p>
            <strong>Description: </strong>
            {description}
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Is done: </strong>
            {isDone ? 'Yes' : 'No'}
          </p>
          {isDone || (
            // highlight-next-line
            <button onClick={() => markTaskAsDone({ id })}>Mark as done.</button>
          )}
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```tsx title="src/pages/Task.tsx"
    import React from 'react'
    // highlight-next-line
    import { useQuery, getTask, markTaskAsDone } from 'wasp/client/operations'

    export const TaskPage = ({ id }: { id: number }) => {
      const { data: task } = useQuery(getTask, { id })

      if (!task) {
        return <h1>"Loading"</h1>
      }

      const { description, isDone } = task
      return (
        <div>
          <p>
            <strong>Description: </strong>
            {description}
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Is done: </strong>
            {isDone ? 'Yes' : 'No'}
          </p>
          {isDone || (
            // highlight-next-line
            <button onClick={() => markTaskAsDone({ id })}>Mark as done.</button>
          )}
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Since Actions don't require reactivity, they are safe to use inside components without a hook. Still, Wasp provides comes with the `useAction` hook you can use to enhance actions. Read all about it in the [API Reference](#api-reference).

##### Using Actions on the server

Calling an Action on the server is similar to calling it on the client.

Here's what you have to do differently:

- Import Actions from `wasp/server/operations` instead of `wasp/client/operations`.
- Make sure you pass in a context object with the user to authenticated Actions.

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js
    import { createTask, markTaskAsDone } from 'wasp/server/operations'

    const user = // Get an AuthUser object, e.g., from context.user

    const newTask = await createTask(
      { description: 'Learn TypeScript' },
      { user },
    )
    await markTaskAsDone({ id: 1 }, { user })
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts
    import { createTask, markTaskAsDone } from 'wasp/server/operations'

    const user = // Get an AuthUser object, e.g., from context.user

    // TypeScript automatically infers the return values and type-checks
    // the payloads.
    const newTask = await createTask(
      { description: 'Keep learning TypeScript' },
      { user },
    )
    await markTaskAsDone({ id: 1 }, { user })
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Error Handling

For security reasons, all exceptions thrown in the Action's NodeJS implementation are sent to the client as responses with the HTTP status code `500`, with all other details removed.
Hiding error details by default helps against accidentally leaking possibly sensitive information over the network.

If you do want to pass additional error information to the client, you can construct and throw an appropriate `HttpError` in your implementation:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/actions.js"
    import { HttpError } from 'wasp/server'

    export const createTask = async (args, context) => {
      throw new HttpError(
        403, // status code
        "You can't do this!", // message
        { foo: 'bar' } // data
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/actions.ts"
    import { type CreateTask } from 'wasp/server/operations'
    import { HttpError } from 'wasp/server'

    export const createTask: CreateTask = async (args, context) => {
      throw new HttpError(
        403, // status code
        "You can't do this!", // message
        { foo: 'bar' } // data
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Using Entities in Actions

In most cases, resources used in Actions will be [Entities](../../data-model/entities.md).
To use an Entity in your Action, add it to the `action` declaration in Wasp:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp {4,9} title="main.wasp"

    action createTask {
      fn: import { createTask } from "@src/actions.js",
      entities: [Task]
    }

    action markTaskAsDone {
      fn: import { markTaskAsDone } from "@src/actions.js",
      entities: [Task]
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp {4,9} title="main.wasp"

    action createTask {
      fn: import { createTask } from "@src/actions.js",
      entities: [Task]
    }

    action markTaskAsDone {
      fn: import { markTaskAsDone } from "@src/actions.js",
      entities: [Task]
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Wasp will inject the specified Entity into the Action's `context` argument, giving you access to the Entity's Prisma API.
Wasp invalidates frontend Query caches by looking at the Entities used by each Action/Query. Read more about Wasp's smart cache invalidation [here](#cache-invalidation).

The object `context.entities.Task` exposes `prisma.task` from [Prisma's CRUD API](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/crud).

### Cache Invalidation

One of the trickiest parts of managing a web app's state is making sure the data returned by the Queries is up to date.
Since Wasp uses _react-query_ for Query management, we must make sure to invalidate Queries (more specifically, their cached results managed by _react-query_) whenever they become stale.

It's possible to invalidate the caches manually through several mechanisms _react-query_ provides (e.g., refetch, direct invalidation).
However, since manual cache invalidation quickly becomes complex and error-prone, Wasp offers a faster and a more effective solution to get you started: **automatic Entity-based Query cache invalidation**.
Because Actions can (and most often do) modify the state while Queries read it, Wasp invalidates a Query's cache whenever an Action that uses the same Entity is executed.

For example, if the Action `createTask` and Query `getTasks` both use the Entity `Task`, executing `createTask` may cause the cached result of `getTasks` to become outdated. In response, Wasp will invalidate it, causing `getTasks` to refetch data from the server and update it.

In practice, this means that Wasp keeps the Queries "fresh" without requiring you to think about cache invalidation.

On the other hand, this kind of automatic cache invalidation can become wasteful (some updates might not be necessary) and will only work for Entities. If that's an issue, you can use the mechanisms provided by _react-query_ for now, and expect more direct support in Wasp for handling those use cases in a nice, elegant way.

If you wish to optimistically set cache values after performing an Action, you can do so using [optimistic updates](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33009713). Configure them using Wasp's [useAction hook](#the-useaction-hook-and-optimistic-updates). This is currently the only manual cache invalidation mechanism Wasps supports natively. For everything else, you can always rely on _react-query_.

### Differences Between Queries and Actions

Actions and Queries are two closely related concepts in Wasp. They might seem to perform similar tasks, but Wasp treats them differently, and each concept represents a different thing.

Here are the key differences between Queries and Actions:

1. Actions can (and often should) modify the server's state, while Queries are only permitted to read it. Wasp relies on you adhering to this convention when performing cache invalidations, so it's crucial to follow it.
2. Actions don't need to be reactive, so you can call them directly. However, Wasp does provide a [`useAction` React hook](#the-useaction-hook-and-optimistic-updates) for adding extra behavior to the Action (like optimistic updates).
3. `action` declarations in Wasp are mostly identical to `query` declarations. The only difference lies in the declaration's name.

### API Reference

#### Declaring Actions in Wasp

The `action` declaration supports the following fields:

- `fn: ExtImport` Required!

  The import statement of the Action's NodeJs implementation.

- `entities: [Entity]`

  A list of entities you wish to use inside your Action.
  For instructions on using Entities in Actions, take a look at [the guide](#using-entities-in-actions).

##### Example

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    Declaring the Action:

    ```wasp
    query createFoo {
        fn: import { createFoo } from "@src/actions.js"
        entities: [Foo]
    }
    ```

    Enables you to import and use it anywhere in your code (on the server or the client):

    ```js
    // Use it on the client
    import { createFoo } from 'wasp/client/operations'

    // Use it on the server
    import { createFoo } from 'wasp/server/operations'
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    Declaring the Action:

    ```wasp
    query createFoo {
        fn: import { createFoo } from "@src/actions.js"
        entities: [Foo]
    }
    ```

    Enables you to import and use it anywhere in your code (on the server or the client):

    ```ts
    // Use it on the client
    import { createFoo } from 'wasp/client/operations'

    // Use it on the server
    import { createFoo } from 'wasp/server/operations'
    ```

    As well as the following type import on the server:

    ```ts
    import { type CreateFoo } from 'wasp/server/operations'
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Implementing Actions

The Action's implementation is a NodeJS function that takes two arguments (it can be an `async` function if you need to use the `await` keyword).
Since both arguments are positional, you can name the parameters however you want, but we'll stick with `args` and `context`:

1. `args` (type depends on the Action)

   An object containing the data **passed in when calling the Action** (e.g., filtering conditions).
   Check [the usage examples](#using-actions) to see how to pass this object to the Action.

2. `context` (type depends on the Action)

   An additional context object **passed into the Action by Wasp**. This object contains user session information, as well as information about entities. Check the [section about using entities in Actions](#using-entities-in-actions) to see how to use the entities field on the `context` object, or the [auth section](../../auth/overview#using-the-contextuser-object) to see how to use the `user` object.

<ShowForTs>
  After you [declare the Action](#declaring-actions), Wasp generates a generic type you can use when defining its implementation.
  For the Action declared as `createSomething`, the generated type is called `CreateSomething`:

  ```ts
  import { type CreateSomething } from 'wasp/server/operations'
  ```

  It expects two (optional) type arguments:

  1. `Input`

     The type of the `args` object (the Action's input payload). The default value is `never`.

  2. `Output`

     The type of the Action's return value (the Action's output payload). The default value is `unknown`.

  The defaults were chosen to make the type signature as permissive as possible. If don't want your Action to take/return anything, use `void` as a type argument.
</ShowForTs>

##### Example

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    The following Action:

    ```wasp
    action createFoo {
        fn: import { createFoo } from "@src/actions.js"
        entities: [Foo]
    }
    ```

    Expects to find a named export `createfoo` from the file `src/actions.js`

    ```js title="actions.js"
    export const createFoo = (args, context) => {
      // implementation
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    The following Action:

    ```wasp
    action createFoo {
        fn: import { createFoo } from "@src/actions.js"
        entities: [Foo]
    }
    ```

    Expects to find a named export `createfoo` from the file `src/actions.js`

    You can use the generated type `CreateFoo` and specify the Action's inputs and outputs using its type arguments.

    ```ts title="actions.ts"
    import { type CreateFoo } from 'wasp/server/operations'

    type Foo = // ...

    export const createFoo: CreateFoo<{ bar: string }, Foo> = (args, context) => {
      // implementation
    };
    ```

    In this case, the Action expects to receive an object with a `bar` field of type `string` (this is the type of `args`), and return a value of type `Foo` (this must match the type of the Action's return value).
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### The `useAction` Hook and Optimistic Updates

Make sure you understand how [Queries](../../data-model/operations/queries.md) and [Cache Invalidation](#cache-invalidation) work before reading this chapter.

When using Actions in components, you can enhance them with the help of the `useAction` hook. This hook comes bundled with Wasp, and is used for decorating Wasp Actions.
In other words, the hook returns a function whose API matches the original Action while also doing something extra under the hood (depending on how you configure it).

The `useAction` hook accepts two arguments:

- `actionFn` Required!

  The Wasp Action (the client-side Action function generated by Wasp based on a Action declaration) you wish to enhance.

- `actionOptions`

  An object configuring the extra features you want to add to the given Action. While this argument is technically optional, there is no point in using the `useAction` hook without providing it (it would be the same as using the Action directly). The Action options object supports the following fields:

  - `optimisticUpdates`

    An array of objects where each object defines an [optimistic update](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33009713) to perform on the Query cache. To define an optimistic update, you must specify the following properties:

    - `getQuerySpecifier` Required!

    A function returning the Query specifier (a value used to address the Query you want to update). A Query specifier is an array specifying the query function and arguments. For example, to optimistically update the Query used with `useQuery(fetchFilteredTasks, {isDone: true }]`, your `getQuerySpecifier` function would have to return the array `[fetchFilteredTasks, { isDone: true}]`. Wasp will forward the argument you pass into the decorated Action to this function (you can use the properties of the added/changed item to address the Query).

    - `updateQuery` Required!

    The function used to perform the optimistic update. It should return the desired state of the cache. Wasp will call it with the following arguments:

    - `item` - The argument you pass into the decorated Action.
    - `oldData` - The currently cached value for the Query identified by the specifier.

:::caution
The `updateQuery` function must be a pure function. It must return the desired cache value identified by the `getQuerySpecifier` function and _must not_ perform any side effects.

Also, make sure you only update the Query caches affected by your Action causing the optimistic update (Wasp cannot yet verify this).

Finally, your implementation of the `updateQuery` function should work correctly regardless of the state of `oldData` (e.g., don't rely on array positioning). If you need to do something else during your optimistic update, you can directly use _react-query_'s lower-level API (read more about it [here](#advanced-usage)).
:::

Here's an example showing how to configure the Action `markTaskAsDone` that toggles a task's `isDone` status to perform an optimistic update:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```jsx title="src/pages/Task.jsx"
    import React from 'react'
    import {
      useQuery,

      // highlight-start
      const markTaskAsDoneOptimistically = useAction(markTaskAsDone, {

            updateQuery: (_payload, oldData) => ({ ...oldData, isDone: true }),
          },
        ],
      })

              Mark as done.
            </button>
          )}
        </div>
      )
    }

    export default TaskPage
    ```

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```tsx title="src/pages/Task.tsx"

          )}
        </div>
      );
    };

    export default TaskPage;
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

##### Advanced usage

The `useAction` hook currently only supports specifying optimistic updates. You can expect more features in future versions of Wasp.

Wasp's optimistic update API is deliberately small and focuses exclusively on updating Query caches (as that's the most common use case). You might need an API that offers more options or a higher level of control. If that's the case, instead of using Wasp's `useAction` hook, you can use _react-query_'s `useMutation` hook and directly work with [their low-level API](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/framework/react/guides/optimistic-updates).

If you decide to use _react-query_'s API directly, you will need access to Query cache key. Wasp internally uses this key but abstracts it from the programmer. Still, you can easily obtain it by accessing the `queryCacheKey` property on any Query:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js
    import { getTasks } from 'wasp/client/operations'

    const queryKey = getTasks.queryCacheKey
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts
    import { getTasks } from 'wasp/client/operations'

    const queryKey = getTasks.queryCacheKey
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Automatic CRUD

If you have a lot of experience writing full-stack apps, you probably ended up doing some of the same things many times: listing data, adding data, editing it, and deleting it.

Wasp makes handling these boring bits easy by offering a higher-level concept called Automatic CRUD.

With a single declaration, you can tell Wasp to automatically generate server-side logic (i.e., Queries and Actions) for creating, reading, updating and deleting [Entities](../data-model/entities). As you update definitions for your Entities, Wasp automatically regenerates the backend logic.

:::caution Early preview
This feature is currently in early preview and we are actively working on it. Read more about [our plans](#future-of-crud-operations-in-wasp) for CRUD operations.
:::

### Overview

Imagine we have a `Task` entity and we want to enable CRUD operations for it:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
model Task {
  id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  description String
  isDone      Boolean
}
```

We can then define a new `crud` called `Tasks`.

We specify to use the `Task` entity and we enable the `getAll`, `get`, `create` and `update` operations (let's say we don't need the `delete` operation).

```wasp title="main.wasp"
crud Tasks {
  entity: Task,
  operations: {
    getAll: {
      isPublic: true, // by default only logged in users can perform operations
    },
    get: {},
    create: {
      overrideFn: import { createTask } from "@src/tasks.js",
    },
    update: {},
  },
}
```

1. It uses default implementation for `getAll`, `get`, and `update`,
2. ... while specifying a custom implementation for `create`.
3. `getAll` will be public (no auth needed), while the rest of the operations will be private.

Here's what it looks like when visualized:

<ImgWithCaption alt="Automatic CRUD with Wasp" source="img/crud_diagram.png" caption="Visualization of the Tasks crud declaration" />

We can now use the CRUD queries and actions we just specified in our client code.

Keep reading for an example of Automatic CRUD in action, or skip ahead for the [API Reference](#api-reference).

### Example: A Simple TODO App

Let's create a full-app example that uses automatic CRUD. We'll stick to using the `Task` entity from the previous example, but we'll add a `User` entity and enable [username and password](../auth/username-and-pass) based auth.

<ImgWithCaption alt="Automatic CRUD with Wasp" source="img/crud-guide.gif" caption="We are building a simple tasks app with username based auth" />

#### Creating the App

We can start by running `wasp new tasksCrudApp` and then adding the following to the `main.wasp` file:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app tasksCrudApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "Tasks Crud App",

  // We enabled auth and set the auth method to username and password
  auth: {
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      usernameAndPassword: {},
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login",
  },
}

// Tasks app routes
route RootRoute { path: "/", to: MainPage }
page MainPage {
  component: import { MainPage } from "@src/MainPage.jsx",
  authRequired: true,
}

route LoginRoute { path: "/login", to: LoginPage }
page LoginPage {
  component: import { LoginPage } from "@src/LoginPage.jsx",
}

route SignupRoute { path: "/signup", to: SignupPage }
page SignupPage {
  component: import { SignupPage } from "@src/SignupPage.jsx",
}
```

And let's define our entities in the `schema.prisma` file:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  tasks Task[]
}

// We defined a Task entity on which we'll enable CRUD later on
model Task {
  id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  description String
  isDone      Boolean
  userId      Int
  user        User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```

We can then run `wasp db migrate-dev` to create the database and run the migrations.

#### Adding CRUD to the `Task` Entity ✨

Let's add the following `crud` declaration to our `main.wasp` file:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
// ...

crud Tasks {
  entity: Task,
  operations: {
    getAll: {},
    create: {
      overrideFn: import { createTask } from "@src/tasks.js",
    },
  },
}
```

You'll notice that we enabled only `getAll` and `create` operations. This means that only these operations will be available.

We also overrode the `create` operation with a custom implementation. This means that the `create` operation will not be generated, but instead, the `createTask` function from `@src/tasks.{js,ts}` will be used.

#### Our Custom `create` Operation

We need a custom `create` operation because we want to make sure that the task is connected to the user creating it.
Automatic CRUD doesn't yet support this by default.
Read more about the default implementations [here](#declaring-a-crud-with-default-options).

Here's the `src/tasks.{js,ts}` file:

      }

      const { description, isDone } = args
      const { Task } = context.entities

      return await Task.create({
        data: {
          description,
          isDone,
          // highlight-start

    type CreateTaskInput = { description: string; isDone: boolean }

    export const createTask: Tasks.CreateAction<CreateTaskInput, Task> = async (
      args,
      context
    ) => {
      if (!context.user) {
        throw new HttpError(401, 'User not authenticated.')
      }

      const { description, isDone } = args
      const { Task } = context.entities

      return await Task.create({
        data: {
          description,
          isDone,
          // highlight-start
          // Connect the task to the user that is creating it
          user: {
            connect: {

          },
          // highlight-end
        },
      })
    }
    ```

    Wasp automatically generates the `Tasks.CreateAction` type based on the CRUD declaration in your Wasp file.
    Use it to type the CRUD action's implementation.

    The `Tasks.CreateAction` type works exactly like the types Wasp generates for [Queries](../data-model/operations/queries#type-support-for-queries) and [Actions](../data-model/operations/actions#type-support-for-actions).
    In other words, annotating the action with `Tasks.CreateAction` tells TypeScript about the type of the Action's `context` object, while the two type arguments allow you to specify the Action's inputs and outputs.

That's it. You can now run `wasp start` and see the app in action. ⚡️

You should see a login page and a signup page. After you log in, you should see a page with a list of tasks and a form to create new tasks.

### Future of CRUD Operations in Wasp

CRUD operations currently have a limited set of knowledge about the business logic they are implementing.

- For example, they don't know that a task should be connected to the user that is creating it. This is why we had to override the `create` operation in the example above.
- Another thing: they are not aware of the authorization rules. For example, they don't know that a user should not be able to create a task for another user. In the future, we will be adding role-based authorization to Wasp, and we plan to make CRUD operations aware of the authorization rules.
- Another issue is input validation and sanitization. For example, we might want to make sure that the task description is not empty.

CRUD operations are a mechanism for getting a backend up and running quickly, but it depends on the information it can get from the Wasp app. The more information that it can pick up from your app, the more powerful it will be out of the box.

We plan on supporting CRUD operations and growing them to become the easiest way to create your backend. Follow along on [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/1253) to see how we are doing.

### API Reference

CRUD declaration works on top of an existing entity declaration. We'll fully explore the API using two examples:

1. A basic CRUD declaration that relies on default options.
2. A more involved CRUD declaration that uses extra options and overrides.

#### Declaring a CRUD With Default Options

If we create CRUD operations for an entity named `Task`, like this:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    crud Tasks { // crud name here is "Tasks"
      entity: Task,
      operations: {
        get: {},
        getAll: {},
        create: {},
        update: {},
        delete: {},
      },
    }
    ```

    Wasp will give you the following default implementations:

    **get** - returns one entity based on the `id` field

    ```js
    // ...
    // Wasp uses the field marked with `@id` in Prisma schema as the id field.
    return Task.findUnique({ where: { id: args.id } })
    ```

    **getAll** - returns all entities

    ```js
    // ...

    // If the operation is not public, Wasp checks if an authenticated user
    // is making the request.

    return Task.findMany()
    ```

    **create** - creates a new entity

    ```js
    // ...
    return Task.create({ data: args.data })
    ```

    **update** - updates an existing entity

    ```js
    // ...
    // Wasp uses the field marked with `@id` in Prisma schema as the id field.
    return Task.update({ where: { id: args.id }, data: args.data })
    ```

    **delete** - deletes an existing entity

    ```js
    // ...
    // Wasp uses the field marked with `@id` in Prisma schema as the id field.
    return Task.delete({ where: { id: args.id } })
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    crud Tasks { // crud name here is "Tasks"
      entity: Task,
      operations: {
        get: {},
        getAll: {},
        create: {},
        update: {},
        delete: {},
      },
    }
    ```

    Wasp will give you the following default implementations:

    **get** - returns one entity based on the `id` field

    ```ts
    // ...
    // Wasp uses the field marked with `@id` in Prisma schema as the id field.
    return Task.findUnique({ where: { id: args.id } })
    ```

    **getAll** - returns all entities

    ```ts
    // ...

    // If the operation is not public, Wasp checks if an authenticated user
    // is making the request.

    return Task.findMany()
    ```

    **create** - creates a new entity

    ```ts
    // ...
    return Task.create({ data: args.data })
    ```

    **update** - updates an existing entity

    ```ts
    // ...
    // Wasp uses the field marked with `@id` in Prisma schema as the id field.
    return Task.update({ where: { id: args.id }, data: args.data })
    ```

    **delete** - deletes an existing entity

    ```ts
    // ...
    // Wasp uses the field marked with `@id` in Prisma schema as the id field.
    return Task.delete({ where: { id: args.id } })
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Current Limitations
In the default `create` and `update` implementations, we are saving all of the data that the client sends to the server. This is not always desirable, i.e. in the case when the client should not be able to modify all of the data in the entity.

[In the future](#future-of-crud-operations-in-wasp), we are planning to add validation of action input, where only the data that the user is allowed to change will be saved.

For now, the solution is to provide an override function. You can override the default implementation by using the `overrideFn` option and implementing the validation logic yourself.

:::

#### Declaring a CRUD With All Available Options

Here's an example of a more complex CRUD declaration:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    crud Tasks { // crud name here is "Tasks"
      entity: Task,
      operations: {
        getAll: {
          isPublic: true, // optional, defaults to false
        },
        get: {},
        create: {
          overrideFn: import { createTask } from "@src/tasks.js", // optional
        },
        update: {},
      },
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    crud Tasks { // crud name here is "Tasks"
      entity: Task,
      operations: {
        getAll: {
          isPublic: true, // optional, defaults to false
        },
        get: {},
        create: {
          overrideFn: import { createTask } from "@src/tasks.js", // optional
        },
        update: {},
      },
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The CRUD declaration features the following fields:

- `entity: Entity` Required!

  The entity to which the CRUD operations will be applied.

- `operations: { [operationName]: CrudOperationOptions }` Required!

  The operations to be generated. The key is the name of the operation, and the value is the operation configuration.

  - The possible values for `operationName` are:
    - `getAll`
    - `get`
    - `create`
    - `update`
    - `delete`
  - `CrudOperationOptions` can have the following fields:
    - `isPublic: bool` - Whether the operation is public or not. If it is public, no auth is required to access it. If it is not public, it will be available only to authenticated users. Defaults to `false`.
    - `overrideFn: ExtImport` - The import statement of the optional override implementation in Node.js.

##### Defining the overrides

Like with actions and queries, you can define the implementation in a Javascript/Typescript file. The overrides are functions that take the following arguments:

- `args`

  The arguments of the operation i.e. the data sent from the client.

- `context`

  Context contains the `user` making the request and the `entities` object with the entity that's being operated on.

<ShowForTs>
  You can also import types for each of the functions you want to override by importing the `{crud name}` from `wasp/server/crud`. The available types are:

  - `{crud name}.GetAllQuery`
  - `{crud name}.GetQuery`
  - `{crud name}.CreateAction`
  - `{crud name}.UpdateAction`
  - `{crud name}.DeleteAction`

  If you have a CRUD named `Tasks`, you would import the types like this:

  ```ts
  import { type Tasks } from 'wasp/server/crud'

  // Each of the types is a generic type, so you can use it like this:
  export const getAllOverride: Tasks.GetAllQuery<Input, Output> = async (
    args,
    context
  ) => {
    // ...
  }
  ```
</ShowForTs>

For a usage example, check the [example guide](../data-model/crud#adding-crud-to-the-task-entity-).

##### Using the CRUD operations in client code

On the client, you import the CRUD operations from `wasp/client/crud` by import the `{crud name}` object. For example, if you have a CRUD called `Tasks`, you would import the operations like this:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```jsx title="SomePage.jsx"
    import { Tasks } from 'wasp/client/crud'
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```tsx title="SomePage.tsx"
    import { Tasks } from 'wasp/client/crud'
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can then access the operations like this:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```jsx title="SomePage.jsx"
    const { data } = Tasks.getAll.useQuery()
    const { data } = Tasks.get.useQuery({ id: 1 })
    const createAction = Tasks.create.useAction()
    const updateAction = Tasks.update.useAction()
    const deleteAction = Tasks.delete.useAction()
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```tsx title="SomePage.tsx"
    const { data } = Tasks.getAll.useQuery()
    const { data } = Tasks.get.useQuery({ id: 1 })
    const createAction = Tasks.create.useAction()
    const updateAction = Tasks.update.useAction()
    const deleteAction = Tasks.delete.useAction()
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

All CRUD operations are implemented with [Queries and Actions](../data-model/operations/overview) under the hood, which means they come with all the features you'd expect (e.g., automatic SuperJSON serialization, full-stack type safety when using TypeScript)

## Databases

[Entities](../data-model/entities.md), [Operations](../data-model/operations/overview) and [Automatic CRUD](../data-model/crud.md) together make a high-level interface for working with your app's data. Still, all that data has to live somewhere, so let's see how Wasp deals with databases.

### Supported Database Backends

Wasp supports multiple database backends. We'll list and explain each one.

#### SQLite

The default database Wasp uses is [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).

When you create a new Wasp project, the `schema.prisma` file will have SQLite as the default database provider:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

// ...
```

<small>
  Read more about how Wasp uses the Prisma schema file in the [Prisma schema file](./prisma-file.md) section.
</small>

When you use the SQLite database, Wasp sets the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for you.

SQLite is a great way to get started with a new project because it doesn't require any configuration, but Wasp can only use it in development. Once you want to deploy your Wasp app to production, you'll need to switch to PostgreSQL and stick with it.

Fortunately, migrating from SQLite to PostgreSQL is pretty simple, and we have [a guide](#migrating-from-sqlite-to-postgresql) to help you.

#### PostgreSQL

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is the most advanced open-source database and one of the most popular databases overall.
It's been in active development for 20+ years.
Therefore, if you're looking for a battle-tested database, look no further.

To use PostgreSQL with Wasp, set the provider to `"postgresql"` in the `schema.prisma` file:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

// ...
```

<small>
  Read more about how Wasp uses the Prisma schema file in the [Prisma schema file](./prisma-file.md) section.
</small>

You'll have to ensure a database instance is running during development to use PostgreSQL. Wasp needs access to your database for commands such as `wasp start` or `wasp db migrate-dev`.

We cover all supported ways of connecting to a database in [the next section](#connecting-to-a-database).

### Connecting to a Database

#### SQLite

If you are using SQLite, you don't need to do anything special to connect to the database. Wasp will take care of it for you.

#### PostgreSQL

If you are using PostgreSQL, Wasp supports two ways of connecting to a database:

1. For managed experience, let Wasp spin up a ready-to-go development database for you.
2. For more control, you can specify a database URL and connect to an existing database that you provisioned yourself.

##### Using the Dev Database provided by Wasp

The command `wasp start db` will start a default PostgreSQL dev database for you.

Your Wasp app will automatically connect to it, just keep `wasp start db` running in the background.
Also, make sure that:

- You have [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and it's available in your `PATH`.
- The port `5432` isn't taken.

:::tip
In case you might want to connect to the dev database through the external tool like `psql` or [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), the credentials are printed in the console when you run `wasp db start`, at the very beginning.
:::

##### Connecting to an existing database

If you want to spin up your own dev database (or connect to an external one), you can tell Wasp about it using the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. Wasp will use the value of `DATABASE_URL` as a connection string.

The easiest way to set the necessary `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is by adding it to the [.env.server](../project/env-vars) file in the root dir of your Wasp project (if that file doesn't yet exist, create it):

```env title=".env.server"
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb
```

Alternatively, you can set it inline when running `wasp` (this applies to all environment variables):

```bash
DATABASE_URL=<my-db-url> wasp ...
```

This trick is useful for running a certain `wasp` command on a specific database.
For example, you could do:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=<production-db-url> wasp db seed myProductionSeed
```

This command seeds the data for a fresh staging or production database. Read more about [seeding the database](#seeding-the-database).

### Migrating from SQLite to PostgreSQL

To run your Wasp app in production, you'll need to switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL.

1. Set the provider to `"postgresql"` in the `schema.prisma` file:

   ```prisma title="schema.prisma"
   datasource db {
     // highlight-next-line
     provider = "postgresql"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }

   // ...
   ```

2. Delete all the old migrations, since they are SQLite migrations and can't be used with PostgreSQL, as well as the SQLite database by running [`wasp clean`](../general/cli#project-commands):

   ```bash
   rm -r migrations/
   wasp clean
   ```

3. Ensure your new database is running (check the [section on connecting to a database](#connecting-to-a-database) to see how). Leave it running, since we need it for the next step.

4. In a different terminal, run `wasp db migrate-dev` to apply the changes and create a new initial migration.

5. That is it, you are all done!

### Seeding the Database

**Database seeding** is a term used for populating the database with some initial data.

Seeding is most commonly used for:

1. Getting the development database into a state convenient for working and testing.
2. Initializing any database (`dev`, `staging`, or `prod`) with essential data it requires to operate.
   For example, populating the Currency table with default currencies, or the Country table with all available countries.

#### Writing a Seed Function

You can define as many **seed functions** as you want in an array under the `app.db.seeds` field:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app MyApp {
      // ...
      db: {
        seeds: [
          import { devSeedSimple } from "@src/dbSeeds.js",
          import { prodSeed } from "@src/dbSeeds.js"
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app MyApp {
      // ...
      db: {
        seeds: [
          import { devSeedSimple } from "@src/dbSeeds.js",
          import { prodSeed } from "@src/dbSeeds.js"
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Each seed function must be an async function that takes one argument, `prisma`, which is a [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/crud) instance used to interact with the database.
This is the same Prisma Client instance that Wasp uses internally.

Since a seed function falls under server-side code, it can import other server-side functions. This is convenient because you might want to seed the database using Actions.

Here's an example of a seed function that imports an Action:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js
    import { createTask } from './actions.js'
    import { sanitizeAndSerializeProviderData } from 'wasp/server/auth'

    export const devSeedSimple = async (prisma) => {
      const user = await createUser(prisma, {
        username: 'RiuTheDog',
        password: 'bark1234',
      })

      await createTask(
        { description: 'Chase the cat' },
        { user, entities: { Task: prisma.task } }
      )
    }

    async function createUser(prisma, data) {
      const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
        data: {
          auth: {
            create: {
              identities: {
                create: {
                  providerName: 'username',
                  providerUserId: data.username,
                  providerData: await sanitizeAndSerializeProviderData({
                    hashedPassword: data.password
                  }),
                },
              },
            },
          },
        },
      })

      return newUser
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts
    import { createTask } from './actions.js'
    import type { DbSeedFn } from 'wasp/server'

    Wasp exports a type called `DbSeedFn` which you can use to easily type your seeding function.
    Wasp defines `DbSeedFn` like this:

    ```typescript
    type DbSeedFn = (prisma: PrismaClient) => Promise<void>
    ```

    Annotating the function `devSeedSimple` with this type tells TypeScript:

    - The seeding function's argument (`prisma`) is of type `PrismaClient`.
    - The seeding function's return value is `Promise<void>`.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Running seed functions

Run the command `wasp db seed` and Wasp will ask you which seed function you'd like to run (if you've defined more than one).

Alternatively, run the command `wasp db seed <seed-name>` to choose a specific seed function right away, for example:

```
wasp db seed devSeedSimple
```

Check the [API Reference](#cli-commands-for-seeding-the-database) for more details on these commands.

:::tip
You'll often want to call `wasp db seed` right after you run `wasp db reset`, as it makes sense to fill the database with initial data after clearing it.
:::

### Customising the Prisma Client

Wasp interacts with the database using the [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client).
To customize the client, define a function in the `app.db.prismaSetupFn` field that returns a Prisma Client instance.
This allows you to configure features like [logging](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/observability-and-logging/logging) or [client extensions](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions):

`app.db` is a dictionary with the following fields (all fields are optional):

- `seeds: [ExtImport]`

  Defines the seed functions you can use with the `wasp db seed` command to seed your database with initial data.
  Read the [Seeding section](#seeding-the-database) for more details.

- `prismaSetupFn: ExtImport`

  Defines a function that sets up the Prisma Client instance. Wasp expects it to return a Prisma Client instance.
  You can use this function to set up [logging](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/observability-and-logging/logging) or [client extensions](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions):

  ```ts title="src/prisma.ts"
  import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

  export const setUpPrisma = () => {
    const prisma = new PrismaClient({
      log: ['query', 'info', 'warn', 'error'],
    })

    return prisma
  }
  ```

#### CLI Commands for Seeding the Database

Use one of the following commands to run the seed functions:

- `wasp db seed`

  If you've only defined a single seed function, this command runs it. If you've defined multiple seed functions, it asks you to choose one interactively.

- `wasp db seed <seed-name>`

  This command runs the seed function with the specified name. The name is the identifier used in its `import` expression in the `app.db.seeds` list.
  For example, to run the seed function `devSeedSimple` which was defined like this:

  <Tabs groupId="js-ts">
    <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
      ```wasp title="main.wasp"

            // ...
            import { devSeedSimple } from "@src/dbSeeds.js",
          ]
        }
      }

          ]
        }
      }
      ```

  Use the following command:

  wasp db seed devSeedSimple
  ```

## Prisma Schema File

Wasp uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to interact with the database. Prisma is a "Next-generation Node.js and TypeScript ORM" that provides a type-safe API for working with your database.

With Prisma, you define your application's data model in a `schema.prisma` file. Read more about how Wasp Entities relate to Prisma models on the [Entities](./entities.md) page.

In Wasp, the `schema.prisma` file is located in your project's root directory:

```c
.
├── main.wasp
...
// highlight-next-line
├── schema.prisma
├── src
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

Wasp uses the `schema.prisma` file to understand your app's data model and generate the necessary code to interact with the database.

### Wasp file and Prisma schema file

Let's see how Wasp and Prisma files work together to define your application.

Here's an example `schema.prisma` file where we defined some database options and two models (User and Task) with a one-to-many relationship:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model User {
  id      Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  tasks   Task[]
}

model Task {
  id          Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  description String
  isDone      Boolean    @default(false)
  user        User       @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId      Int
}
```

Wasp reads this `schema.prisma` file and extracts the info about your database models and database config.

The `datasource` block defines which database you want to use (PostgreSQL in this case) and some other options.

The `generator` block defines how to generate the Prisma Client code that you can use in your application to interact with the database.

<ImgWithCaption alt="Relationship between Wasp file and Prisma file" source="img/data-model/prisma_in_wasp.png" caption="Relationship between Wasp file and Prisma file" />

Finally, Prisma models become Wasp Entities which can be then used in the `main.wasp` file:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "My App",
}

...

// Using Wasp Entities in the Wasp file

query getTasks {
  fn: import { getTasks } from "@src/queries",
  // highlight-next-line
  entities: [Task]
}

job myJob {
  executor: PgBoss,
  perform: {
    fn: import { foo } from "@src/workers/bar"
  },
  // highlight-next-line
  entities: [Task],
}

api fooBar {
  fn: import { fooBar } from "@src/apis",
  // highlight-next-line
  entities: [Task],
  httpRoute: (GET, "/foo/bar/:email")
}

```

In the implementation of the `getTasks` query, `Task` is a Wasp Entity that corresponds to the `Task` model defined in the `schema.prisma` file.

The same goes for the `myJob` job and `fooBar` API, where `Task` is used as an Entity.

To learn more about the relationship between Wasp Entities and Prisma models, check out the [Entities](./entities.md) page.

### Wasp-specific Prisma configuration

Wasp mostly lets you use the Prisma schema file as you would in any other JS/TS project. However, there are some Wasp-specific rules you need to follow.

#### The `datasource` block

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Wasp takes the `datasource` you write and use it as-is.

There are some rules you need to follow:

- You can only use `"postgresql"` or `"sqlite"` as the `provider` because Wasp only supports PostgreSQL and SQLite databases for now.
- You must set the `url` field to `env("DATABASE_URL")` so that Wasp can work properly with your database.

#### The `generator` blocks

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

Wasp requires that there is a `generator` block with `provider = "prisma-client-js"` in the `schema.prisma` file.

You can add additional generators if you need them in your project.

#### The `model` blocks

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
model User {
  id      Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  tasks   Task[]
}

model Task {
  id          Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  description String
  isDone      Boolean    @default(false)
  user        User       @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId      Int
}
```

You can define your models in any way you like, if it's valid Prisma schema code, it will work with Wasp.

#### The `enum` blocks

As our applications grow in complexity, we might want to use [Prisma `enum`s](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/models#defining-enums) to closely define our app's domain. For example, if we had a `Task` model with a boolean `isDone`, and we wanted to start to track whether it is in progress, we could migrate the field to a more expressive type:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
enum TaskStatus {
  NotStarted
  Doing
  Done
}

model Task {
  ...
  state TaskStatus @default(NotStarted)
}
```

Make sure to check [Prisma's enum compatibility with your database](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/database-features#misc).
If it works with Prisma, it will work with Wasp.

##### How to use `enum`s in your code

If you need to access your `enum` cases and their values from your server, you can import them directly from `@prisma/client`:

  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/queries.js"

    export const getOpenTasks  = async (args, context) => {
      return context.entities.Task.findMany({
        orderBy: { id: "asc" },
        where: { NOT: { state: TaskState.Done } },
      });
    };
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/queries.ts"
    import { TaskState } from "@prisma/client";
    import { Task } from "wasp/entities";
    import { type GetTasks } from "wasp/server/operations";

    export const getOpenTasks: GetTasks<void, Task[]> = async (args, context) => {
      return context.entities.Task.findMany({
        orderBy: { id: "asc" },
        where: { NOT: { state: TaskState.Done } },
      });
    };
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can also access them from your client code:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/views/TaskList.jsx"
    import { TaskState } from "@prisma/client";

    const TaskRow = ({ task }) => {
      return (
        <div>
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            id={String(task.id)}
            checked={task.state === TaskState.Done}
          />
          {task.description}
        </div>
      );
    };
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/views/TaskList.tsx"
    import { TaskState } from "@prisma/client";
    import { Task } from "wasp/entities";

    const TaskRow = ({ task }: { task: Task }) => {
      return (
        <div>
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            id={String(task.id)}
            checked={task.state === TaskState.Done}
          />
          {task.description}
        </div>
      );
    };
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note Triple slash comments
Wasp only supports `///` in the _leading_ position:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
model User {
  // highlight-next-line
  /// The unique identifier for the user.
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
}
```

However, Wasp does not support `///` comments in the _trailing_ position:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
model User {
  // highlight-next-line
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement()) /// This is not supported
}
```

We are aware of this issue and are tracking it at [#3041](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/3041), let us know if this is something you need.
:::

### Prisma preview features

Prisma is still in active development and some of its features are not yet stable. To enable various preview features in Prisma, you need to add the `previewFeatures` field to the `generator` block in the `schema.prisma` file.

For example, one useful Prisma preview feature is PostgreSQL extensions support, which allows you to use PostgreSQL extensions like `pg_vector` or `pg_trgm` in your database schema:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
datasource db {
  provider   = "postgresql"
  url        = env("DATABASE_URL")
  extensions = [pgvector(map: "vector")]
}

generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["postgresqlExtensions"]
}

// ...
```

Read more about preview features in the Prisma docs [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/preview-features/client-preview-features) or about using PostgreSQL extensions [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/postgresql-extensions).

# Authentication

## Authentication Overview

Auth is an essential piece of any serious application. That's why Wasp provides authentication and authorization support out of the box.

Here's a 1-minute tour of how full-stack auth works in Wasp:

<div className="video-container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qiro77q-ulI?si=y8Rejsbjb1HJC6FA" frameborder="1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen />
</div>

Enabling auth for your app is optional and can be done by configuring the `auth` field of your `app` declaration:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app MyApp {
  title: "My app",
  //...
  auth: {
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      usernameAndPassword: {}, // use this or email, not both
      email: {}, // use this or usernameAndPassword, not both
      google: {},
      gitHub: {},
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/someRoute"
  }
}

//...
```

<small>
  Read more about the `auth` field options in the [API Reference](#api-reference) section.
</small>

We will provide a quick overview of auth in Wasp and link to more detailed documentation for each auth method.

### Available auth methods

Wasp supports the following auth methods:

<AuthMethodsGrid />

Let's say we enabled the [Username & password](../auth/username-and-pass) authentication.

We get an auth backend with signup and login endpoints. We also get the `user` object in our [Operations](../data-model/operations/overview) and we can decide what to do based on whether the user is logged in or not.

We would also get the [Auth UI](../auth/ui) generated for us. We can set up our login and signup pages where our users can **create their account** and **login**. We can then protect certain pages by setting `authRequired: true` for them. This will make sure that only logged-in users can access them.

We will also have access to the `user` object in our frontend code, so we can show different UI to logged-in and logged-out users. For example, we can show the user's name in the header alongside a **logout button** or a login button if the user is not logged in.

### Different ways to use auth

When you have decided which auth methods you want to support, you can also choose how you want to present the authorization flows to your users.

##### Generated components

This is the fastest way to ship, with Wasp generating ready-made components for your app.
They allow for some customization to make them consistent with your app.
You don't need to implement any UI or logic, and they just work.

<LinkGrid
  links={[
    { title: 'Email', linkTo: './email' },
    { title: 'Username and password', linkTo: './username-and-pass' },
    { title: 'Social Auth', linkTo: './social-auth/overview' },
  ]}
/>

##### Make your own UI {#custom-auth-ui}

Wasp is flexible enough to let you completely customize your login and signup interface.
We give you the auth related functions, and you decide how and when to call them.
This allows for total customization of the look-and-feel, and the interaction, but it needs a bit more work.

<LinkGrid
  links={[
    { title: 'Email', linkTo: './email/create-your-own-ui' },
    { title: 'Username and password', linkTo: './username-and-pass/create-your-own-ui' },
    { title: 'Social Auth', linkTo: './social-auth/create-your-own-ui' },
  ]}
/>

:::tip

You don't have to choose one _or_ the other! Mix-and-match, and use what you need in each moment.
For example, you can create a custom signup screen, but use Wasp's generated components for login.

:::

##### Custom login and signup actions

The previously discussed options should cover the vast majority of cases. But, for the few instances where it is not enough,
you can [create your own signup flows](./advanced/custom-auth-actions.md), with completely custom logic.
This is not recommended, and reserved for advanced use cases.
Please check first if other Wasp features (mainly [auth hooks](./auth-hooks.md)) can handle your requirements.

### Protecting a page with `authRequired`

When declaring a page, you can set the `authRequired` property.

If you set it to `true`, only authenticated users can access the page. Unauthenticated users are redirected to a route defined by the `app.auth.onAuthFailedRedirectTo` field.

```wasp title="main.wasp"
page MainPage {
  component: import Main from "@src/pages/Main",
  authRequired: true
}
```

:::caution Requires auth method
You can only use `authRequired` if your app uses one of the [available auth methods](#available-auth-methods).
:::

If `authRequired` is set to `true`, the page's React component (specified by the `component` property) receives the `user` object as a prop. Read more about the `user` object in the [Accessing the logged-in user section](#accessing-the-logged-in-user).

### Logout action

We provide an action for logging out the user. Here's how you can use it:

```tsx title="src/components/LogoutButton.tsx"

const LogoutButton = () => {
  return <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
}
```

### Accessing the logged-in user

You can get access to the `user` object both on the server and on the client. The `user` object contains the logged-in user's data.

The `user` object has all the fields that you defined in your `User` entity. In addition to that, it will also contain all the auth-related fields that Wasp stores. This includes things like the `username` or the email verification status. For example, if you have a user that signed up using an email and password, the `user` object might look like this:

```ts
const user = {
  // User data
  id: 'cluqsex9500017cn7i2hwsg17',
  address: 'Some address',

  // Auth methods specific data
  identities: {
    email: {
      id: 'user@app.com',
      isEmailVerified: true,
      emailVerificationSentAt: '2024-04-08T10:06:02.204Z',
      passwordResetSentAt: null,
    },
  },
}
```

<ReadMoreAboutAuthEntities />

#### On the client

There are two ways to access the `user` object on the client:

- the `user` prop
- the `useAuth` hook

##### Getting the `user` in authenticated routes

If the page's declaration sets `authRequired` to `true`, the page's React component receives the `user` object as a prop. This is the simplest way to access the user inside an authenticated page:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
// ...

page AccountPage {
  component: import Account from "@src/pages/Account",
  authRequired: true
}
```

```tsx title="src/pages/Account.tsx" auto-js

const AccountPage = ({ user }: { user: AuthUser }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={logout}>Logout</Button>
      {JSON.stringify(user, null, 2)}
    </div>
  )
}

export default AccountPage
```

##### Getting the `user` in non-authenticated routes

Wasp provides a React hook you can use in the client components - `useAuth`.

This hook is a thin wrapper over Wasp's `useQuery` hook and returns data in the same format.

```tsx title="src/pages/MainPage.tsx" auto-js

export function Main() {
  const { data: user } = useAuth()

  if (!user) {
    return (
      <span>
        Please <Link to="/login">login</Link> or{' '}
        <Link to="/signup">sign up</Link>.
      </span>
    )
  } else {
    return (
      <>
        <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
        <Todo />
      </>
    )
  }
}
```
#### On the server

##### Using the `context.user` object

When authentication is enabled, all [queries and actions](../data-model/operations/overview) have access to the `user` object through the `context` argument. `context.user` contains all User entity's fields and the auth identities connected to the user. We strip out the `hashedPassword` field from the identities for security reasons.

```ts title="src/actions.ts" auto-js

type CreateTaskPayload = Pick<Task, 'description'>

export const createTask: CreateTask<CreateTaskPayload, Task> = async (
  args,
  context
) => {
  if (!context.user) {
    throw new HttpError(403)
  }

  const Task = context.entities.Task
  return Task.create({
    data: {
      description: args.description,
      user: {
        connect: { id: context.user.id },
      },
    },
  })
}
```

To implement access control in your app, each operation must check `context.user` and decide what to do. For example, if `context.user` is `undefined` inside a private operation, the user's access should be denied.

When using WebSockets, the `user` object is also available on the `socket.data` object. Read more in the [WebSockets section](../advanced/web-sockets#websocketfn-function).

### Sessions

Wasp's auth uses sessions to keep track of the logged-in user. The session is stored in `localStorage` on the client and in the database on the server. Under the hood, Wasp uses the excellent [Lucia Auth v3](https://v3.lucia-auth.com/) library for session management.

When users log in, Wasp creates a session for them and stores it in the database. The session is then sent to the client and stored in `localStorage`. When users log out, Wasp deletes the session from the database and from `localStorage`.

### User Entity

#### Password Hashing

If you are saving a user's password in the database, you should **never** save it as plain text. You can use Wasp's helper functions for serializing and deserializing provider data which will automatically hash the password for you:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
// ...

action updatePassword {
  fn: import { updatePassword } from "@src/auth",
}
```

```ts title="src/auth.ts" auto-js

  createProviderId,
  findAuthIdentity,
  updateAuthIdentityProviderData,
  getProviderDataWithPassword,
} from 'wasp/server/auth'

export const updatePassword: UpdatePassword<
  { email: string; password: string },
  void
> = async (args, context) => {
  const providerId = createProviderId('email', args.email)
  const authIdentity = await findAuthIdentity(providerId)
  if (!authIdentity) {
    throw new HttpError(400, 'Unknown user')
  }

  const providerData = getProviderDataWithPassword<'email'>(
    authIdentity.providerData
  )

  // Updates the password and hashes it automatically.
  await updateAuthIdentityProviderData(providerId, providerData, {
    hashedPassword: args.password,
  })
}
```

#### Default Validations

When you are using the default authentication flow, Wasp validates the fields with some default validations. These validations run if you use Wasp's built-in [Auth UI](./ui.md) or if you use the provided auth actions.

If you decide to create your [custom auth actions](./advanced/custom-auth-actions.md), you'll need to run the validations yourself.

Default validations depend on the auth method you use.

##### Username & Password

If you use [Username & password](./username-and-pass) authentication, the default validations are:

- The `username` must not be empty
- The `password` must not be empty, have at least 8 characters, and contain a number

Note that `username`s are stored in a **case-insensitive** manner.

##### Email

If you use [Email](./email.md) authentication, the default validations are:

- The `email` must not be empty and a valid email address
- The `password` must not be empty, have at least 8 characters, and contain a number

Note that `email`s are stored in a **case-insensitive** manner.

### Customizing the Signup Process

Sometimes you want to include **extra fields** in your signup process, like first name and last name and save them in the `User` entity.

For this to happen:

- you need to define the fields that you want saved in the database,
- you need to customize the `SignupForm` (in the case of [Email](./email.md) or [Username & Password](./username-and-pass.md) auth)

Other times, you might need to just add some **extra UI** elements to the form, like a checkbox for terms of service. In this case, customizing only the UI components is enough.

Let's see how to do both.

#### 1. Defining Extra Fields

If we want to **save** some extra fields in our signup process, we need to tell our app they exist.

We do that by defining an object where the keys represent the field name, and the values are functions that receive the data sent from the client\* and return the value of the field.

<small>
  \* We exclude the `password` field from this object to prevent it from being saved as plain-text in the database. The `password` field is handled by Wasp's auth backend.
</small>

First, we add the `auth.methods.{authMethod}.userSignupFields` field in our `main.wasp` file. The `{authMethod}` depends on the auth method you are using.

For example, if you are using [Username & Password](./username-and-pass), you would add the `auth.methods.usernameAndPassword.userSignupFields` field:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app crudTesting {
  // ...
  auth: {
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      usernameAndPassword: {
        userSignupFields: import { userSignupFields } from "@src/auth/signup",
      },
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login",
  },
}
```

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
model User {
  id      Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  address String?
}
```

Then we'll define the `userSignupFields` object in the `src/auth/signup.{js,ts}` file:

```ts title="src/auth/signup.ts" auto-js

export const userSignupFields = defineUserSignupFields({
  address: async (data) => {
    const address = data.address
    if (typeof address !== 'string') {
      throw new Error('Address is required')
    }
    if (address.length < 5) {
      throw new Error('Address must be at least 5 characters long')
    }
    return address
  },
})
```

<small>
  Read more about the `userSignupFields` object in the [API Reference](#signup-fields-customization).
</small>

Keep in mind, that these field names need to exist on the `userEntity` you defined in your `main.wasp` file e.g. `address` needs to be a field on the `User` entity you defined in the `schema.prisma` file.

The field function will receive the data sent from the client and it needs to return the value that will be saved into the database. If the field is invalid, the function should throw an error.

:::info Using Validation Libraries

You can use any validation library you want to validate the fields. For example, you can use `zod` like this:

<details>
  <summary>Click to see the code</summary>

  ```ts title="src/auth/signup.ts" auto-js
  import { defineUserSignupFields } from 'wasp/server/auth'
  import * as z from 'zod'

  export const userSignupFields = defineUserSignupFields({
    address: (data) => {
      const AddressSchema = z
        .string({
          required_error: 'Address is required',
          invalid_type_error: 'Address must be a string',
        })
        .min(10, 'Address must be at least 10 characters long')
      const result = AddressSchema.safeParse(data.address)
      if (result.success === false) {
        throw new Error(result.error.issues[0].message)
      }
      return result.data
    },
  })
  ```
</details>

:::

Now that we defined the fields, Wasp knows how to:

1. Validate the data sent from the client
2. Save the data to the database

Next, let's see how to customize [Auth UI](../auth/ui) to include those fields.

#### 2. Customizing the Signup Component

:::tip Using Custom Signup Component

If you are not using Wasp's Auth UI, you can skip this section. Just make sure to include the extra fields in your custom signup form.

Read more about using the signup actions for:

- [Email auth](./email/create-your-own-ui.md)
- [Username & password auth](./username-and-pass/create-your-own-ui.md)
  :::

If you are using Wasp's Auth UI, you can customize the `SignupForm` component by passing the `additionalFields` prop to it. It can be either a list of extra fields or a render function.

##### Using a List of Extra Fields

When you pass in a list of extra fields to the `SignupForm`, they are added to the form one by one, in the order you pass them in.

Inside the list, there can be either **objects** or **render functions** (you can combine them):

1. Objects are a simple way to describe new fields you need, but a bit less flexible than render functions.
2. Render functions can be used to render any UI you want, but they require a bit more code. The render functions receive the `react-hook-form` object and the form state object as arguments.

```tsx title="src/SignupPage.tsx" auto-js

  SignupForm,
  FormError,
  FormInput,
  FormItemGroup,
  FormLabel,
} from 'wasp/client/auth'

export const SignupPage = () => {
  return (
    <SignupForm
      additionalFields={[
        /* The address field is defined using an object */
        {
          name: 'address',
          label: 'Address',
          type: 'input',
          validations: {
            required: 'Address is required',
          },
        },
        /* The phone number is defined using a render function */
        (form, state) => {
          return (
            <FormItemGroup>
              <FormLabel>Phone Number</FormLabel>
              <FormInput
                {...form.register('phoneNumber', {
                  required: 'Phone number is required',
                })}
                disabled={state.isLoading}
              />
              {form.formState.errors.phoneNumber && (
                <FormError>
                  {form.formState.errors.phoneNumber.message}
                </FormError>
              )}
            </FormItemGroup>
          )
        },
      ]}
    />
  )
}
```

<small>
  Read more about the extra fields in the [API Reference](#signupform-customization).
</small>

##### Using a Single Render Function

Instead of passing in a list of extra fields, you can pass in a render function which will receive the `react-hook-form` object and the form state object as arguments. What ever the render function returns, will be rendered below the default fields.

```tsx title="src/SignupPage.tsx" auto-js

export const SignupPage = () => {
  return (
    <SignupForm
      additionalFields={(form, state) => {
        const username = form.watch('username')
        return (
          username && (
            <FormItemGroup>
              Hello there <strong>{username}</strong> 👋
            </FormItemGroup>
          )
        )
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

<small>
  Read more about the render function in the [API Reference](#signupform-customization).
</small>

### API Reference

#### Auth Fields

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app MyApp {
  title: "My app",
  //...
  auth: {
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      usernameAndPassword: {}, // use this or email, not both
      email: {}, // use this or usernameAndPassword, not both
      google: {},
      gitHub: {},
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/someRoute",
  }
}

//...
```

`app.auth` is a dictionary with the following fields:

##### `userEntity: entity` Required!

The entity representing the user connected to your business logic.

<ReadMoreAboutAuthEntities />

##### `methods: dict` Required!

A dictionary of auth methods enabled for the app.

<AuthMethodsGrid />

##### `onAuthFailedRedirectTo: String` Required!

The route to which Wasp should redirect unauthenticated user when they try to access a private page (i.e., a page that has `authRequired: true`).
Check out these [essential docs on auth](../tutorial/auth#adding-auth-to-the-project) to see an example of usage.

##### `onAuthSucceededRedirectTo: String`

The route to which Wasp will send a successfully authenticated after a successful login/signup.
The default value is `"/"`.

:::note
Automatic redirect on successful login only works when using the Wasp-provided [Auth UI](../auth/ui).
:::

#### Signup Fields Customization

If you want to add extra fields to the signup process, the server needs to know how to save them to the database. You do that by defining the `auth.methods.{authMethod}.userSignupFields` field in your `main.wasp` file.

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app crudTesting {
  // ...
  auth: {
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      usernameAndPassword: {
        // highlight-next-line
        userSignupFields: import { userSignupFields } from "@src/auth/signup",
      },
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login",
  },
}
```

Then we'll export the `userSignupFields` object from the `src/auth/signup.{js,ts}` file:

```ts title="src/auth/signup.ts" auto-js

export const userSignupFields = defineUserSignupFields({
  address: async (data) => {
    const address = data.address
    if (typeof address !== 'string') {
      throw new Error('Address is required')
    }
    if (address.length < 5) {
      throw new Error('Address must be at least 5 characters long')
    }
    return address
  },
})
```

The `userSignupFields` object is an object where the keys represent the field name, and the values are functions that receive the data sent from the client\* and return the value of the field.

If the value that the function received is invalid, the function should throw an error.

<small>
  \* We exclude the `password` field from this object to prevent it from being saved as plain text in the database. The `password` field is handled by Wasp's auth backend.
</small>

#### `SignupForm` Customization

To customize the `SignupForm` component, you need to pass in the `additionalFields` prop. It can be either a list of extra fields or a render function.

```tsx title="src/SignupPage.tsx" auto-js

  SignupForm,
  FormError,
  FormInput,
  FormItemGroup,
  FormLabel,
} from 'wasp/client/auth'

export const SignupPage = () => {
  return (
    <SignupForm
      additionalFields={[
        {
          name: 'address',
          label: 'Address',
          type: 'input',
          validations: {
            required: 'Address is required',
          },
        },
        (form, state) => {
          return (
            <FormItemGroup>
              <FormLabel>Phone Number</FormLabel>
              <FormInput
                {...form.register('phoneNumber', {
                  required: 'Phone number is required',
                })}
                disabled={state.isLoading}
              />
              {form.formState.errors.phoneNumber && (
                <FormError>
                  {form.formState.errors.phoneNumber.message}
                </FormError>
              )}
            </FormItemGroup>
          )
        },
      ]}
    />
  )
}
```

The extra fields can be either **objects** or **render functions** (you can combine them):

1. Objects are a simple way to describe new fields you need, but a bit less flexible than render functions.

   The objects have the following properties:

   - `name` Required!
     - the name of the field

   - `label` Required!

     - the label of the field (used in the UI)

   - `type` Required!

     - the type of the field, which can be `input` or `textarea`

   - `validations`
     - an object with the validation rules for the field. The keys are the validation names, and the values are the validation error messages. Read more about the available validation rules in the [react-hook-form docs](https://react-hook-form.com/api/useform/register#register).

2. Render functions receive the `react-hook-form` object and the form state as arguments, and they can use them to render arbitrary UI elements.

   The render function has the following signature:

   ```ts
   type AdditionalSignupFieldRenderFn = (
      hookForm: UseFormReturn,
      formState: FormState
    ) => React.ReactNode
   ```

   - `form` Required!

     The `react-hook-form` object, read more about it in the [react-hook-form docs](https://react-hook-form.com/api/useform). You need to use the `form.register` function to register your fields

   - `state` Required!

     The form state object, which has the following properties:

     - `isLoading: boolean`

       Whether the form is currently submitting

## Auth UI

To make using authentication in your app as easy as possible, Wasp generates the server-side code but also the client-side UI for you. It enables you to quickly get the login, signup, password reset and email verification flows in your app.

Below we cover all of the available UI components and how to use them.

![Auth UI](/img/authui/all_screens.gif)

:::note

Remember that if you need a more custom approach, you can always [create your own UI](./overview.md#custom-auth-ui).

:::

### Overview

After Wasp generates the UI components for your auth, you can use it as is, or customize it to your liking.

Based on the authentication providers you enabled in your `main.wasp` file, the Auth UI will show the corresponding UI (form and buttons). For example, if you enabled e-mail authentication:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp {5} title="main.wasp"
    app MyApp {
      //...
      auth: {
        methods: {
          email: {},
        },
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp {5} title="main.wasp"
    app MyApp {
      //...
      auth: {
        methods: {
          email: {},
        },
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You'll get the following UI:

![Auth UI](/img/authui/login.png)

And then if you enable Google and Github:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp" {6-7}
    app MyApp {
      //...
      auth: {
        methods: {
          email: {},
          google: {},
          github: {},
        },
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp" {6-7}
    app MyApp {
      //...
      auth: {
        methods: {
          email: {},
          google: {},
          github: {},
        },
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The form will automatically update to look like this:

![Auth UI](/img/authui/multiple_providers.png)

Let's go through all of the available components and how to use them.

### Auth Components

The following components are available for you to use in your app:

- [Login form](#login-form)
- [Signup form](#signup-form)
- [Forgot password form](#forgot-password-form)
- [Reset password form](#reset-password-form)
- [Verify email form](#verify-email-form)

#### Login Form

Used with <UsernameAndPasswordPill />, <EmailPill />, <GithubPill />, <GooglePill />, <KeycloakPill />, <SlackPill /> and <DiscordPill /> authentication.

![Login form](/img/authui/login.png)

You can use the `LoginForm` component to build your login page:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    route LoginRoute { path: "/login", to: LoginPage }
    page LoginPage {
      component: import { LoginPage } from "@src/LoginPage.jsx"
    }
    ```

    ```tsx title="src/LoginPage.jsx"
    import { LoginForm } from 'wasp/client/auth'

    // Use it like this
    export function LoginPage() {
      return <LoginForm />
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    route LoginRoute { path: "/login", to: LoginPage }
    page LoginPage {
      component: import { LoginPage } from "@src/LoginPage.tsx"
    }
    ```

    ```tsx title="src/LoginPage.tsx"
    import { LoginForm } from 'wasp/client/auth'

    // Use it like this
    export function LoginPage() {
      return <LoginForm />
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

It will automatically show the correct authentication providers based on your `main.wasp` file.

#### Signup Form

Used with <UsernameAndPasswordPill />, <EmailPill />, <GithubPill />, <GooglePill />, <KeycloakPill />, <SlackPill /> and <DiscordPill /> authentication.

![Signup form](/img/authui/signup.png)

You can use the `SignupForm` component to build your signup page:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    route SignupRoute { path: "/signup", to: SignupPage }
    page SignupPage {
      component: import { SignupPage } from "@src/SignupPage.jsx"
    }
    ```

    ```tsx title="src/SignupPage.jsx"
    import { SignupForm } from 'wasp/client/auth'

    // Use it like this
    export function SignupPage() {
      return <SignupForm />
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    route SignupRoute { path: "/signup", to: SignupPage }
    page SignupPage {
      component: import { SignupPage } from "@src/SignupPage.tsx"
    }
    ```

    ```tsx title="src/SignupPage.tsx"
    import { SignupForm } from 'wasp/client/auth'

    // Use it like this
    export function SignupPage() {
      return <SignupForm />
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

It will automatically show the correct authentication providers based on your `main.wasp` file.

Read more about customizing the signup process like adding additional fields or extra UI in the [Auth Overview](../auth/overview#customizing-the-signup-process) section.

#### Forgot Password Form

Used with <EmailPill /> authentication.

If users forget their password, they can use this form to reset it.

![Forgot password form](/img/authui/forgot_password.png)

You can use the `ForgotPasswordForm` component to build your own forgot password page:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    route RequestPasswordResetRoute { path: "/request-password-reset", to: RequestPasswordResetPage }
    page RequestPasswordResetPage {
      component: import { ForgotPasswordPage } from "@src/ForgotPasswordPage.jsx"
    }
    ```

    ```tsx title="src/ForgotPasswordPage.jsx"
    import { ForgotPasswordForm } from 'wasp/client/auth'

    // Use it like this
    export function ForgotPasswordPage() {
      return <ForgotPasswordForm />
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    route RequestPasswordResetRoute { path: "/request-password-reset", to: RequestPasswordResetPage }
    page RequestPasswordResetPage {
      component: import { ForgotPasswordPage } from "@src/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx"
    }
    ```

    ```tsx title="src/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx"
    import { ForgotPasswordForm } from 'wasp/client/auth'

    // Use it like this
    export function ForgotPasswordPage() {
      return <ForgotPasswordForm />
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Reset Password Form

Used with <EmailPill /> authentication.

After users click on the link in the email they receive after submitting the forgot password form, they will be redirected to this form where they can reset their password.

![Reset password form](/img/authui/reset_password.png)

You can use the `ResetPasswordForm` component to build your reset password page:

#### Verify Email Form

Used with <EmailPill /> authentication.

After users sign up, they will receive an email with a link to this form where they can verify their email.

![Verify email form](/img/authui/email_verification.png)

You can use the `VerifyEmailForm` component to build your email verification page:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    route EmailVerificationRoute { path: "/email-verification", to: EmailVerificationPage }
    page EmailVerificationPage {
      component: import { VerifyEmailPage } from "@src/VerifyEmailPage.jsx"
    }
    ```

    ```tsx title="src/VerifyEmailPage.jsx"
    import { VerifyEmailForm } from 'wasp/client/auth'

    // Use it like this
    export function VerifyEmailPage() {
      return <VerifyEmailForm />
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    route EmailVerificationRoute { path: "/email-verification", to: EmailVerificationPage }
    page EmailVerificationPage {
      component: import { VerifyEmailPage } from "@src/VerifyEmailPage.tsx"
    }
    ```

    ```tsx title="src/VerifyEmailPage.tsx"
    import { VerifyEmailForm } from 'wasp/client/auth'

    // Use it like this
    export function VerifyEmailPage() {
      return <VerifyEmailForm />
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Customization 💅🏻

You customize all of the available forms by passing props to them.

Props you can pass to all of the forms:

1. `appearance` - customize the form colors (via design tokens)
2. `logo` - path to your logo
3. `socialLayout` - layout of the social buttons, which can be `vertical` or `horizontal`

#### 1. Customizing the Colors

We use CSS variables in our styling so you can customize the styles by overriding the default theme tokens.

:::info List of all available tokens

See the [list of all available tokens](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/release/waspc/data/Generator/templates/sdk/wasp/auth/forms/types.ts) which you can override.

:::

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/appearance.js"
    export const authAppearance = {
      colors: {
        brand: '#5969b8', // blue
        brandAccent: '#de5998', // pink
        submitButtonText: 'white',
      },
    }
    ```

    ```jsx title="src/LoginPage.jsx"
    import { LoginForm } from 'wasp/client/auth'
    import { authAppearance } from './appearance'

    export function LoginPage() {
      return (
        <LoginForm
          // Pass the appearance object to the form
          appearance={authAppearance}
        />
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/appearance.ts"
    import type { CustomizationOptions } from 'wasp/client/auth'

    export const authAppearance: CustomizationOptions['appearance'] = {
      colors: {
        brand: '#5969b8', // blue
        brandAccent: '#de5998', // pink
        submitButtonText: 'white',
      },
    }
    ```

    ```tsx title="src/LoginPage.tsx"
    import { LoginForm } from 'wasp/client/auth'
    import { authAppearance } from './appearance'

    export function LoginPage() {
      return (
        <LoginForm
          // Pass the appearance object to the form
          appearance={authAppearance}
        />
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We recommend defining your appearance in a separate file and importing it into your components.

#### 2. Using Your Logo

You can add your logo to the Auth UI by passing the `logo` prop to any of the components.

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```tsx title="src/LoginPage.jsx"
    import { LoginForm } from 'wasp/client/auth'
    import Logo from './logo.png'

    export function LoginPage() {
      return (
        <LoginForm
          // Pass in the path to your logo
          logo={Logo}
        />
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```tsx title="src/LoginPage.tsx"
    import { LoginForm } from 'wasp/client/auth'
    import Logo from './logo.png'

    export function LoginPage() {
      return (
        <LoginForm
          // Pass in the path to your logo
          logo={Logo}
        />
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### 3. Social Buttons Layout

You can change the layout of the social buttons by passing the `socialLayout` prop to any of the components. It can be either `vertical` or `horizontal` (default).

If we pass in `vertical`:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```tsx title="src/LoginPage.jsx"
    import { LoginForm } from 'wasp/client/auth'

    export function LoginPage() {
      return (
        <LoginForm
          // Pass in the socialLayout prop
          socialLayout="vertical"
        />
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```tsx title="src/LoginPage.tsx"
    import { LoginForm } from 'wasp/client/auth'

    export function LoginPage() {
      return (
        <LoginForm
          // Pass in the socialLayout prop
          socialLayout="vertical"
        />
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We get this:

![Vertical social buttons](/img/authui/vertical_social_buttons.png)

#### Let's Put Everything Together 🪄

If we provide the logo and custom colors:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```ts title="src/appearance.js"
    export const appearance = {
      colors: {
        brand: '#5969b8', // blue
        brandAccent: '#de5998', // pink
        submitButtonText: 'white',
      },
    }
    ```

    ```tsx title="src/LoginPage.jsx"
    import { LoginForm } from 'wasp/client/auth'

    import { authAppearance } from './appearance'
    import todoLogo from './todoLogo.png'

    export function LoginPage() {
      return <LoginForm appearance={appearance} logo={todoLogo} />
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/appearance.ts"
    import type { CustomizationOptions } from 'wasp/client/auth'

    export const appearance: CustomizationOptions['appearance'] = {
      colors: {
        brand: '#5969b8', // blue
        brandAccent: '#de5998', // pink
        submitButtonText: 'white',
      },
    }
    ```

    ```tsx title="src/LoginPage.tsx"
    import { LoginForm } from 'wasp/client/auth'

    import { authAppearance } from './appearance'
    import todoLogo from './todoLogo.png'

    export function LoginPage() {
      return <LoginForm appearance={appearance} logo={todoLogo} />
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We get a form looking like this:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/authui/custom_login.gif" alt="Custom login form" />
</div>

## Username & Password Auth Overview

Wasp supports username & password authentication out of the box with login and signup flows. It provides you with the server-side implementation and the UI components for the client side.

### Setting Up Username & Password Authentication

To set up username authentication we need to:

1. Enable username authentication in the Wasp file
2. Add the `User` entity
3. Add the auth routes and pages
4. Use Auth UI components in our pages

Structure of the `main.wasp` file we will end up with:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
// Configuring e-mail authentication
app myApp {
  auth: { ... }
}

// Defining routes and pages
route SignupRoute { ... }
page SignupPage { ... }
// ...
```

#### 1. Enable Username Authentication

Let's start with adding the following to our `main.wasp` file:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp" {11}
    app myApp {
      wasp: {
        version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
      },
      title: "My App",
      auth: {
        // 1. Specify the user entity (we'll define it next)
        userEntity: User,
        methods: {
          // 2. Enable username authentication
          usernameAndPassword: {},
        },
        onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"  {11}
    app myApp {
      wasp: {
        version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
      },
      title: "My App",
      auth: {
        // 1. Specify the user entity (we'll define it next)
        userEntity: User,
        methods: {
          // 2. Enable username authentication
          usernameAndPassword: {},
        },
        onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Read more about the `usernameAndPassword` auth method options [here](#fields-in-the-usernameandpassword-dict).

#### 2. Add the User Entity

The `User` entity can be as simple as including only the `id` field:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```prisma title="schema.prisma"
    // 3. Define the user entity
    model User {
      // highlight-next-line
      id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
      // Add your own fields below
      // ...
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```prisma title="schema.prisma"
    // 3. Define the user entity
    model User {
      // highlight-next-line
      id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
      // Add your own fields below
      // ...
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<ReadMoreAboutAuthEntities />

#### 3. Add the Routes and Pages

Next, we need to define the routes and pages for the authentication pages.

Add the following to the `main.wasp` file:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...
    route LoginRoute { path: "/login", to: LoginPage }
    page LoginPage {
      component: import { Login } from "@src/pages/auth.jsx"
    }
    route SignupRoute { path: "/signup", to: SignupPage }
    page SignupPage {
      component: import { Signup } from "@src/pages/auth.jsx"
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...
    route LoginRoute { path: "/login", to: LoginPage }
    page LoginPage {
      component: import { Login } from "@src/pages/auth.tsx"
    }
    route SignupRoute { path: "/signup", to: SignupPage }
    page SignupPage {
      component: import { Signup } from "@src/pages/auth.tsx"
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We'll define the React components for these pages in the `src/pages/auth.{jsx,tsx}` file below.

#### 4. Create the Client Pages

:::info
We are using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style the pages. Read more about how to add it [here](../project/css-frameworks).
:::

Let's create a `auth.{jsx,tsx}` file in the `src/pages` folder and add the following to it:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```tsx title="src/pages/auth.jsx"
    import { LoginForm, SignupForm } from 'wasp/client/auth'
    import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'

    export function Login() {
      return (
        <Layout>
          <LoginForm />
          <br />
          <span className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900">
            Don't have an account yet? <Link to="/signup">go to signup</Link>.
          </span>
        </Layout>
      )
    }

    export function Signup() {
      return (
        <Layout>
          <SignupForm />
          <br />
          <span className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900">
            I already have an account (<Link to="/login">go to login</Link>).
          </span>
        </Layout>
      )
    }

    // A layout component to center the content
    export function Layout({ children }) {
      return (
        <div className="h-full w-full bg-white">
          <div className="flex min-h-[75vh] min-w-full items-center justify-center">
            <div className="h-full w-full max-w-sm bg-white p-5">
              <div>{children}</div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```tsx title="src/pages/auth.tsx"
    import { LoginForm, SignupForm } from 'wasp/client/auth'
    import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'

    export function Login() {
      return (
        <Layout>
          <LoginForm />
          <br />
          <span className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900">
            Don't have an account yet? <Link to="/signup">go to signup</Link>.
          </span>
        </Layout>
      )
    }

    export function Signup() {
      return (
        <Layout>
          <SignupForm />
          <br />
          <span className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900">
            I already have an account (<Link to="/login">go to login</Link>).
          </span>
        </Layout>
      )
    }

    // A layout component to center the content
    export function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
      return (
        <div className="h-full w-full bg-white">
          <div className="flex min-h-[75vh] min-w-full items-center justify-center">
            <div className="h-full w-full max-w-sm bg-white p-5">
              <div>{children}</div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We imported the generated Auth UI components and used them in our pages. Read more about the Auth UI components [here](../auth/ui).

#### Conclusion

That's it! We have set up username authentication in our app. 🎉

Running `wasp db migrate-dev` and then `wasp start` should give you a working app with username authentication. If you want to put some of the pages behind authentication, read the [auth overview docs](../auth/overview).

### Using Auth

To read more about how to set up the logout button and how to get access to the logged-in user in our client and server code, read the [auth overview docs](../auth/overview).

When you receive the `user` object [on the client or the server](./overview.md#accessing-the-logged-in-user), you'll be able to access the user's username like this:

## Create your own UI for Username & Password Auth

The login and signup flows are pretty standard: they allow the user to sign up and then log in with their username and password. The signup flow validates the username and password and then creates a new user entity in the database.

:::tip
Read more about the default email and password validation rules in the [auth overview docs](../overview.md#default-validations).
:::

Even though Wasp offers premade [Auth UI](../ui.md) for your authentication flows, there are times where you might want more customization, so we also give you the option to create your own UI and call Wasp's auth actions on your own code, similar to how Auth UI does it under the hood.

### Example code

Below you can find a starting point for making your own UI in the client code. You can customize any of its look and behaviour, just make sure to call the `signup()` or `login()` functions imported from `wasp/client/auth`.

### API Reference

You can import the following functions from `wasp/client/auth`:

#### `login()`

An action for logging in the user.

It takes one argument:

- `data: object` Required!

  It has the following fields:

  - `username: string` Required!

  - `password: string` Required!

:::note
When using the exposed `login()` function, make sure to implement your redirect on success login logic (e.g. redirecting to home).
:::

#### `signup()`

An action for signing up the user. This action does not log in the user, you still need to call `login()`.

It takes one argument:

- `data: object` Required!

  It has the following fields:

  - `username: string` Required!

  - `password: string` Required!

:::info
By default, Wasp will only save the `username` and `password` fields. If you want to add extra fields to your signup process, read about [defining extra signup fields](../overview.md#customizing-the-signup-process).
:::

## Email Auth Overview

Wasp supports e-mail authentication out of the box, along with email verification and "forgot your password?" flows. It provides you with the server-side implementation and email templates for all of these flows.

![Auth UI](/img/authui/all_screens.gif)

<MultipleIdentitiesWarning />

### Setting Up Email Authentication

We'll need to take the following steps to set up email authentication:

1. Enable email authentication in the Wasp file
2. Add the `User` entity
3. Add the auth routes and pages
4. Use Auth UI components in our pages
5. Set up the email sender

Structure of the `main.wasp` file we will end up with:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
// Configuring e-mail authentication
app myApp {
  auth: { ... },
  emailSender: { ... }
}

// Defining routes and pages
route SignupRoute { ... }
page SignupPage { ... }
// ...
```

#### 1. Enable Email Authentication in `main.wasp`

Let's start with adding the following to our `main.wasp` file:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app myApp {
      wasp: {
        version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
      },
      title: "My App",
      auth: {
        // 1. Specify the user entity (we'll define it next)
        userEntity: User,
        methods: {
          // 2. Enable email authentication
          email: {
            // 3. Specify the email from field
            fromField: {
              name: "My App Postman",
              email: "hello@itsme.com"
            },
            // 4. Specify the email verification and password reset options (we'll talk about them later)
            emailVerification: {
              clientRoute: EmailVerificationRoute,
            },
            passwordReset: {
              clientRoute: PasswordResetRoute,
            },
          },
        },
        onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login",
        onAuthSucceededRedirectTo: "/"
      },
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app myApp {
      wasp: {
        version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
      },
      title: "My App",
      auth: {
        // 1. Specify the user entity (we'll define it next)
        userEntity: User,
        methods: {
          // 2. Enable email authentication
          email: {
            // 3. Specify the email from field
            fromField: {
              name: "My App Postman",
              email: "hello@itsme.com"
            },
            // 4. Specify the email verification and password reset options (we'll talk about them later)
            emailVerification: {
              clientRoute: EmailVerificationRoute,
            },
            passwordReset: {
              clientRoute: PasswordResetRoute,
            },
          },
        },
        onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login",
        onAuthSucceededRedirectTo: "/"
      },
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Read more about the `email` auth method options [here](#fields-in-the-email-dict).

#### 2. Add the User Entity

The `User` entity can be as simple as including only the `id` field:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```prisma title="schema.prisma"
    // 5. Define the user entity
    model User {
      // highlight-next-line
      id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
      // Add your own fields below
      // ...
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```prisma title="schema.prisma"
    // 5. Define the user entity
    model User {
      // highlight-next-line
      id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
      // Add your own fields below
      // ...
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<ReadMoreAboutAuthEntities />

#### 3. Add the Routes and Pages

Next, we need to define the routes and pages for the authentication pages.

Add the following to the `main.wasp` file:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    route LoginRoute { path: "/login", to: LoginPage }
    page LoginPage {
      component: import { Login } from "@src/pages/auth.jsx"
    }

    route SignupRoute { path: "/signup", to: SignupPage }
    page SignupPage {
      component: import { Signup } from "@src/pages/auth.jsx"
    }

    route RequestPasswordResetRoute { path: "/request-password-reset", to: RequestPasswordResetPage }
    page RequestPasswordResetPage {
      component: import { RequestPasswordReset } from "@src/pages/auth.jsx",
    }

    route PasswordResetRoute { path: "/password-reset", to: PasswordResetPage }
    page PasswordResetPage {
      component: import { PasswordReset } from "@src/pages/auth.jsx",
    }

    route EmailVerificationRoute { path: "/email-verification", to: EmailVerificationPage }
    page EmailVerificationPage {
      component: import { EmailVerification } from "@src/pages/auth.jsx",
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    route LoginRoute { path: "/login", to: LoginPage }
    page LoginPage {
      component: import { Login } from "@src/pages/auth.tsx"
    }

    route SignupRoute { path: "/signup", to: SignupPage }
    page SignupPage {
      component: import { Signup } from "@src/pages/auth.tsx"
    }

    route RequestPasswordResetRoute { path: "/request-password-reset", to: RequestPasswordResetPage }
    page RequestPasswordResetPage {
      component: import { RequestPasswordReset } from "@src/pages/auth.tsx",
    }

    route PasswordResetRoute { path: "/password-reset", to: PasswordResetPage }
    page PasswordResetPage {
      component: import { PasswordReset } from "@src/pages/auth.tsx",
    }

    route EmailVerificationRoute { path: "/email-verification", to: EmailVerificationPage }
    page EmailVerificationPage {
      component: import { EmailVerification } from "@src/pages/auth.tsx",
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We'll define the React components for these pages in the `src/pages/auth.{jsx,tsx}` file below.

#### 4. Create the Client Pages

:::info
We are using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style the pages. Read more about how to add it [here](../project/css-frameworks).
:::

Let's create a `auth.{jsx,tsx}` file in the `src/pages` folder and add the following to it:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```tsx title="src/pages/auth.jsx"
    import {
      LoginForm,
      SignupForm,
      VerifyEmailForm,
      ForgotPasswordForm,
      ResetPasswordForm,
    } from 'wasp/client/auth'
    import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'

    export function Login() {
      return (
        <Layout>
          <LoginForm />
          <br />
          <span className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900">
            Don't have an account yet? <Link to="/signup">go to signup</Link>.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900">
            Forgot your password? <Link to="/request-password-reset">reset it</Link>.
          </span>
        </Layout>
      )
    }

    export function Signup() {
      return (
        <Layout>
          <SignupForm />
          <br />
          <span className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900">

          </span>
        </Layout>
      )
    }

    export function EmailVerification() {
      return (
        <Layout>
          <VerifyEmailForm />
          <br />
          <span className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900">
            If everything is okay, <Link to="/login">go to login</Link>
          </span>
        </Layout>
      )
    }

    export function RequestPasswordReset() {
      return (
        <Layout>
          <ForgotPasswordForm />
        </Layout>
      )
    }

    export function PasswordReset() {

            If everything is okay, <Link to="/login">go to login</Link>
          </span>
        </Layout>
      )
    }

    // A layout component to center the content
    export function Layout({ children }) {
      return (
        <div className="h-full w-full bg-white">
          <div className="flex min-h-[75vh] min-w-full items-center justify-center">

      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We imported the generated Auth UI components and used them in our pages. Read more about the Auth UI components [here](../auth/ui).

#### 5. Set up an Email Sender

To support e-mail verification and password reset flows, we need an e-mail sender. Luckily, Wasp supports several email providers out of the box.

We'll use the `Dummy` provider to speed up the setup. It just logs the emails to the console instead of sending them. You can use any of the [supported email providers](../advanced/email#providers).

To set up the `Dummy` provider to send emails, add the following to the `main.wasp` file:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app myApp {
      // ...
      // 7. Set up the email sender
      emailSender: {
        provider: Dummy,
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app myApp {
      // ...
      // 7. Set up the email sender
      emailSender: {
        provider: Dummy,
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Conclusion

That's it! We have set up email authentication in our app. 🎉

Running `wasp db migrate-dev` and then `wasp start` should give you a working app with email authentication. If you want to put some of the pages behind authentication, read the [auth overview](../auth/overview).

### Login and Signup Flows

#### Login

![Auth UI](/img/authui/login.png)

#### Signup

![Auth UI](/img/authui/signup.png)

Some of the behavior you get out of the box:

1. Rate limiting

We are limiting the rate of sign-up requests to **1 request per minute** per email address. This is done to prevent spamming.

2. Preventing user email leaks

If somebody tries to signup with an email that already exists and it's verified, we _pretend_ that the account was created instead of saying it's an existing account. This is done to prevent leaking the user's email address.

3. Allowing registration for unverified emails

If a user tries to register with an existing but **unverified** email, we'll allow them to do that. This is done to prevent bad actors from locking out other users from registering with their email address.

4. Password validation

Read more about the default password validation rules and how to override them in [auth overview docs](../auth/overview).

### Email Verification Flow

:::info Automatic email verification in development

In development mode, you can skip the email verification step by setting the `SKIP_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_IN_DEV` environment variable to `true` in your `.env.server` file:

```env title=".env.server"
SKIP_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_IN_DEV=true
```

This is useful when you are developing your app and don't want to go through the email verification flow every time you sign up. It can be also useful when you are writing automated tests for your app.
:::

By default, Wasp requires the e-mail to be verified before allowing the user to log in. This is done by sending a verification email to the user's email address and requiring the user to click on a link in the email to verify their email address.

Our setup looks like this:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    emailVerification: {
        clientRoute: EmailVerificationRoute,
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    emailVerification: {
        clientRoute: EmailVerificationRoute,
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When the user receives an e-mail, they receive a link that goes to the client route specified in the `clientRoute` field. In our case, this is the `EmailVerificationRoute` route we defined in the `main.wasp` file.

The content of the e-mail can be customized, read more about it [here](#emailverification-emailverificationconfig-).

#### Email Verification Page

We defined our email verification page in the `auth.{jsx,tsx}` file.

![Auth UI](/img/authui/email_verification.png)

### Password Reset Flow

Users can request a password and then they'll receive an e-mail with a link to reset their password.

Some of the behavior you get out of the box:

1. Rate limiting

We are limiting the rate of sign-up requests to **1 request per minute** per email address. This is done to prevent spamming.

2. Preventing user email leaks

If somebody requests a password reset with an unknown email address, we'll give back the same response as if the user requested a password reset successfully. This is done to prevent leaking information.

Our setup in `main.wasp` looks like this:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

#### Request Password Reset Page

Users request their password to be reset by going to the `/request-password-reset` route. We defined our request password reset page in the `auth.{jsx,tsx}` file.

![Request password reset page](/img/authui/forgot_password_after.png)

#### Password Reset Page

When the user receives an e-mail, they receive a link that goes to the client route specified in the `clientRoute` field. In our case, this is the `PasswordResetRoute` route we defined in the `main.wasp` file.

![Request password reset page](/img/authui/reset_password_after.png)

Users can enter their new password there.

The content of the e-mail can be customized, read more about it [here](#passwordreset-passwordresetconfig-).

##### Password

- `ensurePasswordIsPresent(args)`

  Checks if the password is present and throws an error if it's not.

- `ensureValidPassword(args)`

  Checks if the password is valid and throws an error if it's not. Read more about the validation rules [here](../auth/overview#default-validations).

### Using Auth

To read more about how to set up the logout button and how to get access to the logged-in user in our client and server code, read the [auth overview docs](../auth/overview).

When you receive the `user` object [on the client or the server](./overview.md#accessing-the-logged-in-user), you'll be able to access the user's email and other information like this:

<EmailData />

<AccessingUserDataNote />

## Create your own UI for Email Auth

When using the email auth provider, users log in with their email address and a password. On signup, Wasp validates the data and sends a verification email. The user account is not active until the user clicks the link in the verification email. Also, the user can reset their password through a similar flow.

:::tip
Read more about the default email and password validation rules in the [auth overview docs](../overview.md#default-validations).
:::

Even though Wasp offers premade [Auth UI](../ui.md) for your authentication flows, there are times when you might want more customization, so we also give you the option to create your own UI and call Wasp's auth actions from your own code, similar to how Auth UI does it under the hood.

### Example code

Below you can find a starting point for making your own UI in the client code. This example has all the necessary components to handle login, signup, email verification, and the password reset flow. You can customize any of its look and behaviour, just make sure to call the functions imported from `wasp/client/auth`.

### API Reference

You can import the following functions from `wasp/client/auth`:

#### `login()`

An action for logging in the user. Make sure to do a redirect on success (e.g. to the main page of the app).

It takes one argument:

- `data: object` Required!

  It has the following fields:

  - `email: string` Required!

  - `password: string` Required!

#### `signup()`

An action for signing up the user and starting the email verification. The user will not be logged in after this, as they still need
to verify their email.

It takes one argument:

- `data: object` Required!

  It has the following fields:

  - `email: string` Required!

  - `password: string` Required!

:::info
By default, Wasp will only save the `email` and `password` fields. If you want to add extra fields to your signup process, read about [defining extra signup fields](../overview.md#customizing-the-signup-process).
:::

#### `verifyEmail()`

An action for marking the email as valid and the user account as active. Make sure to do a redirect on success (e.g. to the login page).

It takes one argument:

- `data: object` Required!

  It has the following fields:

  - `token: string` Required!

    The token that was created when signing up. It will be set as a URL Query Parameter named `token`.

#### `requestPasswordReset()`

An action for asking for a password reset email. This doesn't immediately reset their password, just sends the email.

It takes one argument:

- `data: object` Required!

  It has the following fields:

  - `email: string` Required!

#### `resetPassword()`

An action for confirming a password reset and providing the new password. Make sure to do a redirect on success (e.g. to the login page).

It takes one argument:

- `data: object` Required!

  It has the following fields:

  - `token: string` Required!

    The token that was created when requesting the password reset. It will be set as a URL Query Parameter named `token`.

  - `password: string` Required!

    The new password for the user.

## Social Auth Overview

Social login options (e.g., _Log in with Google_) are a great (maybe even the best) solution for handling user accounts.
A famous old developer joke tells us _"The best auth system is the one you never have to make."_

Wasp wants to make adding social login options to your app as painless as possible.

Using different social providers gives users a chance to sign into your app via their existing accounts on other platforms (Google, GitHub, etc.).

This page goes through the common behaviors between all supported social login providers and shows you how to customize them.
It also gives an overview of Wasp's UI helpers - the quickest possible way to get started with social auth.

### Available Providers

Wasp currently supports the following social login providers:

<SocialAuthGrid />

### User Entity

Wasp requires you to declare a `userEntity` for all `auth` methods (social or otherwise).
This field tells Wasp which Entity represents the user.

Here's what the full setup looks like:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "My App",
  auth: {
    // highlight-next-line
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      google: {}
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  },
}
```

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
// highlight-next-line
model User {
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
}
```

### Default Behavior

<DefaultBehaviour />

### Overrides

By default, Wasp doesn't store any information it receives from the social login provider. It only stores the user's ID specific to the provider.

If you wish to store more information about the user, you can override the default behavior. You can do this by defining the `userSignupFields` and `configFn` fields in `main.wasp` for each provider.

You can create custom signup setups, such as allowing users to define a custom username after they sign up with a social provider.

#### Example: Allowing User to Set Their Username

If you want to modify the signup flow (e.g., let users choose their own usernames), you will need to go through three steps:

1. The first step is adding a `isSignupComplete` property to your `User` Entity. This field will signal whether the user has completed the signup process.
2. The second step is overriding the default signup behavior.
3. The third step is implementing the rest of your signup flow and redirecting users where appropriate.

Let's go through both steps in more detail.

##### 1. Adding the `isSignupComplete` Field to the `User` Entity

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
model User {
  id               Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  username         String? @unique
  // highlight-next-line
  isSignupComplete Boolean @default(false)
}
```

##### 2. Overriding the Default Behavior

Declare an import under `app.auth.methods.google.userSignupFields` (the example assumes you're using Google):

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "My App",
  auth: {
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      google: {
        // highlight-next-line
        userSignupFields: import { userSignupFields } from "@src/auth/google"
      }
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  },
}

// ...
```

And implement the imported function:

```ts title="src/auth/google.ts" auto-js

export const userSignupFields = defineUserSignupFields({
  isSignupComplete: () => false,
})
```

<GetUserFieldsType />

##### 3. Showing the Correct State on the Client

You can check the `isSignupComplete` flag on the `user` object.
Authenticated pages come with the [`user` prop](../../auth/overview#getting-the-user-in-authenticated-routes) which gives you access to the current user. If the `user` prop is out of reach, fetch the current user with the  [`useAuth()` hook](../../auth/overview#getting-the-user-in-non-authenticated-routes).

Depending on the flag's value, you can redirect users to the appropriate signup step.

For example:

1. When the user lands on the homepage, check the value of `user.isSignupComplete`.
2. If it's `false`, it means the user has started the signup process but hasn't yet chosen their username. Therefore, you can redirect them to `EditUserDetailsPage` where they can edit the `username` property.

```tsx title="src/HomePage.tsx" auto-js

export function HomePage({ user }: { user: AuthUser }) {
  if (user.isSignupComplete === false) {
    return <Navigate to="/edit-user-details" />
  }

  // ...
}
```

The same general principle applies to more complex signup procedures, just change the boolean `isSignupComplete` property to a property like `currentSignupStep` that can hold more values.

#### Using the User's Provider Account Details

Account details are provider-specific.
Each provider has their own rules for defining the `userSignupFields` and `configFn` fields:

<SocialAuthGrid pagePart="#overrides" />

- Allowed fields in `app.auth`

## GitHub

Wasp supports GitHub Authentication out of the box.
GitHub is a great external auth choice when you're building apps for developers, as most of them already have a GitHub account.

Letting your users log in using their GitHub accounts turns the signup process into a breeze.

Let's walk through enabling GitHub Authentication, explain some of the default settings, and show how to override them.

### Setting up GitHub Auth

Enabling GitHub Authentication comes down to a series of steps:

1. Enabling GitHub authentication in the Wasp file.
2. Adding the `User` entity.
3. Creating a GitHub OAuth app.
4. Adding the necessary Routes and Pages
5. Using Auth UI components in our Pages.

<WaspFileStructureNote />

#### 1. Adding GitHub Auth to Your Wasp File

Let's start by properly configuring the Auth object:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "My App",
  auth: {
    // highlight-next-line
    // 1. Specify the User entity  (we'll define it next)
    // highlight-next-line
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      // highlight-next-line
      // 2. Enable GitHub Auth
      // highlight-next-line
      gitHub: {}
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  },
}
```

#### 2. Add the User Entity

Let's now define the `app.auth.userEntity` entity in the `schema.prisma` file:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
// 3. Define the user entity
model User {
  // highlight-next-line
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  // Add your own fields below
  // ...
}
```

#### 3. Creating a GitHub OAuth App

To use GitHub as an authentication method, you'll first need to create a GitHub OAuth App and provide Wasp with your client key and secret. Here's how you do it:

1. Log into your GitHub account and navigate to: https://github.com/settings/developers.
2. Select **New OAuth App**.
3. Supply required information.

<img alt="GitHub Applications Screenshot" src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations-github-1.png')} width="400px" />

- For **Authorization callback URL**:
  - For development, put: `http://localhost:3001/auth/github/callback`.
  - Once you know on which URL your API server will be deployed, you can create a new app with that URL instead e.g. `https://your-server-url.com/auth/github/callback`.

4. Hit **Register application**.
5. Hit **Generate a new client secret** on the next page.
6. Copy your Client ID and Client secret as you'll need them in the next step.

#### 4. Adding Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to the `.env.server` file at the root of your project (take their values from the previous step):

```bash title=".env.server"
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret
```

#### 5. Adding the Necessary Routes and Pages

Let's define the necessary authentication Routes and Pages.

Add the following code to your `main.wasp` file:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
// ...

route LoginRoute { path: "/login", to: LoginPage }
page LoginPage {
  component: import { Login } from "@src/pages/auth"
}
```

We'll define the React components for these pages in the `src/pages/auth.{jsx,tsx}` file below.

#### 6. Creating the Client Pages

:::info
We are using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style the pages. Read more about how to add it [here](../../project/css-frameworks).
:::

Let's create a `auth.{jsx,tsx}` file in the `src/pages` folder and add the following to it:

```tsx title="src/pages/auth.tsx" auto-js

export function Login() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <LoginForm />
    </Layout>
  )
}

// A layout component to center the content
export function Layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="h-full w-full bg-white">
      <div className="flex min-h-[75vh] min-w-full items-center justify-center">
        <div className="h-full w-full max-w-sm bg-white p-5">
          <div>{children}</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

We imported the generated Auth UI components and used them in our pages. Read more about the Auth UI components [here](../../auth/ui).

#### Conclusion

Yay, we've successfully set up GitHub Auth! 🎉

![GitHub Auth](/img/auth/github.png)

Running `wasp db migrate-dev` and `wasp start` should now give you a working app with authentication.
To see how to protect specific pages (i.e., hide them from non-authenticated users), read the docs on [using auth](../../auth/overview).

### Default Behaviour

Add `gitHub: {}` to the `auth.methods` dictionary to use it with default settings.

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "My App",
  auth: {
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      // highlight-next-line
      gitHub: {}
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  },
}
```

<DefaultBehaviour />

### Overrides

<OverrideIntro />

#### Data Received From GitHub

We are using GitHub's API and its `/user` and `/user/emails` endpoints to get the user data.

:::info We combine the data from the two endpoints

You'll find the emails in the `emails` property in the object that you receive in `userSignupFields`.

This is because we combine the data from the `/user` and `/user/emails` endpoints **if the `user` or `user:email` scope is requested.**

:::

The data we receive from GitHub on the `/user` endpoint looks something this:

```json
{
  "login": "octocat",
  "id": 1,
  "name": "monalisa octocat",
  "avatar_url": "https://github.com/images/error/octocat_happy.gif",
  "gravatar_id": ""
  // ...
}
```

And the data from the `/user/emails` endpoint looks something like this:

```json
[
  {
    "email": "octocat@github.com",
    "verified": true,
    "primary": true,
    "visibility": "public"
  }
]
```

The fields you receive will depend on the scopes you requested. By default we don't specify any scopes. If you want to get the emails, you need to specify the `user` or `user:email` scope in the `configFn` function.

<small>
  For an up to date info about the data received from GitHub, please refer to the [GitHub API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/users/users?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-the-authenticated-user).
</small>

#### Using the Data Received From GitHub

<OverrideExampleIntro />

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "My App",
  auth: {
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      gitHub: {
        // highlight-next-line
        configFn: import { getConfig } from "@src/auth/github",
        // highlight-next-line
        userSignupFields: import { userSignupFields } from "@src/auth/github"
      }
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  },
}
```

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
model User {
  id          Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  username    String @unique
  displayName String
}

// ...
```

```ts title="src/auth/github.ts" auto-js

export const userSignupFields = defineUserSignupFields({
  username: () => 'hardcoded-username',
  displayName: (data: any) => data.profile.name,
})

export function getConfig() {
  return {
    scopes: ['user'],
  }
}
```

<GetUserFieldsType />

### Using Auth

<UsingAuthNote />

When you receive the `user` object [on the client or the server](../overview.md#accessing-the-logged-in-user), you'll be able to access the user's GitHub ID like this:

<GithubData />

<AccessingUserDataNote />

### API Reference

<ApiReferenceIntro />

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "My App",
  auth: {
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      gitHub: {
        // highlight-next-line
        configFn: import { getConfig } from "@src/auth/github",
        // highlight-next-line
        userSignupFields: import { userSignupFields } from "@src/auth/github"
      }
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  },
}
```

The `gitHub` dict has the following properties:

- #### `configFn: ExtImport`

  This function should return an object with the scopes for the OAuth provider.

  ```ts title="src/auth/github.ts" auto-js
  export function getConfig() {
    return {
      scopes: [],
    }
  }
  ```

- #### `userSignupFields: ExtImport`

  Read more about the `userSignupFields` function [here](../overview#1-defining-extra-fields).

## Google

Wasp supports Google Authentication out of the box.
Google Auth is arguably the best external auth option, as most users on the web already have Google accounts.

Enabling it lets your users log in using their existing Google accounts, greatly simplifying the process and enhancing the user experience.

Let's walk through enabling Google authentication, explain some of the default settings, and show how to override them.

### Setting up Google Auth

Enabling Google Authentication comes down to a series of steps:

1. Enabling Google authentication in the Wasp file.
2. Adding the `User` entity.
3. Creating a Google OAuth app.
4. Adding the necessary Routes and Pages
5. Using Auth UI components in our Pages.

<WaspFileStructureNote />

#### 1. Adding Google Auth to Your Wasp File

Let's start by properly configuring the Auth object:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "My App",
  auth: {
    // 1. Specify the User entity (we'll define it next)
    // highlight-next-line
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      // 2. Enable Google Auth
      // highlight-next-line
      google: {}
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  },
}
```

`userEntity` is explained in [the social auth overview](./overview.md#user-entity).

#### 2. Adding the User Entity

Let's now define the `app.auth.userEntity` entity in the `schema.prisma` file:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
// 3. Define the user entity
model User {
  // highlight-next-line
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  // Add your own fields below
  // ...
}
```

#### 3. Creating a Google OAuth App

To use Google as an authentication method, you'll first need to create a Google project and provide Wasp with your client key and secret. Here's how you do it:

1. Create a Google Cloud Platform account if you do not already have one: https://cloud.google.com/
2. Create and configure a new Google project here: https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate

    ![Google Console Screenshot 1](/img/integrations-google-v2-1.png)

    ![Google Console Screenshot 2](/img/integrations-google-v2-2.png)

3. Search for **Google Auth** in the top bar (1), click on **Google Auth Platform** (2). Then click on **Get Started** (3).

    ![Google Console Screenshot 3](/img/integrations-google-v2-3.png)

    ![Google Console Screenshot 4](/img/integrations-google-v2-4.png)

4. Fill out you app information. For the **Audience** field, we will go with **External**. When you're done, click **Create**.

    ![Google Console Screenshot 5](/img/integrations-google-v2-5.png)

    ![Google Console Screenshot 6](/img/integrations-google-v2-6.png)

5. You should now be in the **OAuth Overview** page. Click on **Create OAuth Client** (1).

    ![Google Console Screenshot 7](/img/integrations-google-v2-7.png)

6. Fill out the form. These are the values for a typical Wasp application:

    | # | Field                    | Value                                        |
    | - | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
    | 1 | Application type         | Web application                              |
    | 2 | Name                     | (your wasp app name)                         |
    | 3 | Authorized redirect URIs | `http://localhost:3001/auth/google/callback` |

    :::note
    Once you know on which URL(s) your API server will be deployed, also add those URL(s) to the **Authorized redirect URIs**.\
    For example: `https://your-server-url.com/auth/google/callback`
    :::

    ![Google Console Screenshot 8](/img/integrations-google-v2-8.png)

    Then click on **Create** (4).

7. You will see a box saying **OAuth client created**. Click on **OK**.

8. Click on the name of your newly-created app.

    ![Google Console Screenshot 10](/img/integrations-google-v2-10.png)

9. On the right-hand side, you will see your **Client ID** (1) and **Client secret** (2). **Copy them somewhere safe, as you will need them for your app.**

    ![Google Console Screenshot 11](/img/integrations-google-v2-11.png)

    :::info
    These are the credentials your app will use to authenticate with Google. Do not share them anywhere publicly, as anyone with these credentials can impersonate your app and access user data.
    :::

10. Click on **Data Access** (1) in the left-hand menu, then click on **Add or remove scopes** (2). You should select `userinfo.profile` (3), and optionally `userinfo.email` (4), or any other scopes you want to use. Remember to click **Update** and **Save** when done.

11. Go to **Audience** (1) in the left-hand menu, and add any test users you want (2). This is useful for testing your app before going live. You can add any email addresses you want to test with.

    ![Google Console Screenshot 14](/img/integrations-google-v2-14.png)

12. Finally, you can go to **Branding** (1) in the left-hand menu, and customize your app's branding in the Google login page. _This is optional_, but recommended if you want to make your app look more professional.

#### 4. Adding Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to the `.env.server` file at the root of your project (take their values from the previous step):

```bash title=".env.server"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

#### 5. Adding the Necessary Routes and Pages

Let's define the necessary authentication Routes and Pages.

Add the following code to your `main.wasp` file:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
// ...

route LoginRoute { path: "/login", to: LoginPage }
page LoginPage {
  component: import { Login } from "@src/pages/auth"
}
```

We'll define the React components for these pages in the `src/pages/auth.{jsx,tsx}` file below.

#### 6. Create the Client Pages

:::info
We are using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style the pages. Read more about how to add it [here](../../project/css-frameworks).
:::

Let's now create a `auth.{jsx,tsx}` file in the `src/pages`.
It should have the following code:

```tsx title="src/pages/auth.tsx" auto-js

export function Login() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <LoginForm />
    </Layout>
  )
}

// A layout component to center the content
export function Layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="h-full w-full bg-white">
      <div className="flex min-h-[75vh] min-w-full items-center justify-center">
        <div className="h-full w-full max-w-sm bg-white p-5">
          <div>{children}</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

:::info Auth UI
Our pages use an automatically-generated Auth UI component. Read more about Auth UI components [here](../../auth/ui).
:::

#### Conclusion

Yay, we've successfully set up Google Auth! 🎉

![Google Auth](/img/auth/google.png)

Running `wasp db migrate-dev` and `wasp start` should now give you a working app with authentication.
To see how to protect specific pages (i.e., hide them from non-authenticated users), read the docs on [using auth](../../auth/overview).

### Default Behaviour

Add `google: {}` to the `auth.methods` dictionary to use it with default settings:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "My App",
  auth: {
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      // highlight-next-line
      google: {}
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  },
}
```

<DefaultBehaviour />

### Overrides

<OverrideIntro />

#### Data Received From Google

We are using Google's API and its `/userinfo` endpoint to fetch the user's data.

The data received from Google is an object which can contain the following fields:

```json
[
  "name",
  "given_name",
  "family_name",
  "email",
  "email_verified",
  "aud",
  "exp",
  "iat",
  "iss",
  "locale",
  "picture",
  "sub"
]
```

The fields you receive depend on the scopes you request. The default scope is set to `profile` only. If you want to get the user's email, you need to specify the `email` scope in the `configFn` function.

<small>
  For an up to date info about the data received from Google, please refer to the [Google API documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect#an-id-tokens-payload).

## Keycloak

Wasp supports Keycloak Authentication out of the box.

[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) is an open-source identity and access management solution for modern applications and services. Keycloak provides both SAML and OpenID protocol solutions. It also has a very flexible and powerful administration UI.

Let's walk through enabling Keycloak authentication, explain some of the default settings, and show how to override them.

### Setting up Keycloak Auth

Enabling Keycloak Authentication comes down to a series of steps:

1. Enabling Keycloak authentication in the Wasp file.
2. Adding the `User` entity.
3. Creating a Keycloak client.
4. Adding the necessary Routes and Pages
5. Using Auth UI components in our Pages.

<WaspFileStructureNote />

#### 1. Adding Keycloak Auth to Your Wasp File

Let's start by properly configuring the Auth object:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "My App",
  auth: {
    // 1. Specify the User entity (we'll define it next)
    // highlight-next-line
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      // 2. Enable Keycloak Auth
      // highlight-next-line
      keycloak: {}
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  },
}
```

`userEntity` is explained in [the social auth overview](./overview.md#user-entity).

#### 2. Adding the User Entity

Let's now define the `app.auth.userEntity` entity in the `schema.prisma` file:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
// 3. Define the user entity
model User {
  // highlight-next-line
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  // Add your own fields below
  // ...
}
```

#### 3. Creating a Keycloak Client

1. Log into your Keycloak admin console.
2. Under **Clients**, click on **Create Client**.

![Keycloak Screenshot 1](/img/auth/keycloak/1-keycloak.png)

1. Fill in the **Client ID** and choose a name for the client.

![Keycloak Screenshot 2](/img/auth/keycloak/2-keycloak.png)

1. In the next step, enable **Client Authentication**.

![Keycloak Screenshot 3](/img/auth/keycloak/3-keycloak.png)

1. Under **Valid Redirect URIs**, add `http://localhost:3001/auth/keycloak/callback` for local development.

![Keycloak Screenshot 4](/img/auth/keycloak/4-keycloak.png)

- Once you know on which URL(s) your API server will be deployed, also add those URL(s).
- For example: `https://my-server-url.com/auth/keycloak/callback`.

1. Click **Save**.
2. In the **Credentials** tab, copy the **Client Secret** value, which we'll use in the next step.

![Keycloak Screenshot 5](/img/auth/keycloak/5-keycloak.png)

#### 4. Adding Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to the `.env.server` file at the root of your project (take their values from the previous step):

```bash title=".env.server"
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=your-keycloak-client-id
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET=your-keycloak-client-secret
KEYCLOAK_REALM_URL=https://your-keycloak-url.com/realms/master
```

We assumed in the `KEYCLOAK_REALM_URL` env variable that you are using the `master` realm. If you are using a different realm, replace `master` with your realm name.

#### 5. Adding the Necessary Routes and Pages

Let's define the necessary authentication Routes and Pages.

Add the following code to your `main.wasp` file:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
// ...

route LoginRoute { path: "/login", to: LoginPage }
page LoginPage {
  component: import { Login } from "@src/pages/auth"
}
```

We'll define the React components for these pages in the `src/pages/auth.{jsx,tsx}` file below.

#### 6. Create the Client Pages

}

// A layout component to center the content
export function Layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="h-full w-full bg-white">
      <div className="flex min-h-[75vh] min-w-full items-center justify-center">
        <div className="h-full w-full max-w-sm bg-white p-5">

## Slack

Wasp supports Slack Authentication out of the box.

Using Slack Authentication is perfect when you build a control panel for a Slack app.

Let's walk through enabling Slack Authentication, explain some quirks, explore default settings and show how to override them.

### Setting up Slack Auth

Enabling Slack Authentication comes down to a series of steps:

1. Enabling Slack authentication in the Wasp file.
2. Adding the `User` entity.
3. Creating Slack App.
4. Adding the necessary Routes and Pages
5. Using Auth UI components in our Pages.

<WaspFileStructureNote />

#### 1. Enabling Slack authentication in the Wasp file.

Now let's properly configure the Auth object:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "My App",
  auth: {
    // highlight-next-line
    // 1. Specify the User entity  (we'll define it next)
    // highlight-next-line
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      // highlight-next-line
      // 2. Enable Slack Auth
      // highlight-next-line
      slack: {}
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  },
}
```

#### 2. Add the User Entity

Let's now define the `app.auth.userEntity` entity in the `schema.prisma` file:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
// 3. Define the user entity
model User {
  // highlight-next-line
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  // Add your own fields below
  // ...
}
```

#### 3. Creating a Slack App

To use Slack as an authentication method, you'll first need to create a Slack App and provide Wasp with your client key and secret. Here's how you do it:

1. Log into your Slack account and navigate to: https://api.slack.com/apps.
2. Select **Create New App**.
3. Click "From scratch"
3. Enter App Name and select workspace that should host your app.

<img alt="Slack Applications Screenshot" src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations-slack-1.png')} width="400px" />

4. Go to the **OAuth & Permissions** tab on the sidebar and click **Add New Redirect URL**. 
    - Enter the value `https://<subdomain>.local.lt/auth/slack/callback`, where `<subdomain>` is your selected localtunnel subdomain.
    - Slack requires us to use HTTPS even when developing, [read below](#slack-https) how to set it up.

4. Hit **Save URLs**.
5. Go to **Basic Information** tab
6. Hit **Show** next to **Client Secret**
6. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret as you'll need them in the next step.

:::tip

Be precise with your redirect URL. Slack’s redirect URLs are case-sensitive and sensitive to trailing slashes.
For example, `https://your-app.loca.lt/auth/slack/callback` and `https://your-app.loca.lt/auth/slack/callback/` are **not** the same.
:::

#### 4. Adding Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to the `.env.server` file at the root of your project (take their values from the previous step):

```bash title=".env.server"
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=your-slack-client-id
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=your-slack-client-secret
```

#### 5. Adding the Necessary Routes and Pages

Let's define the necessary authentication Routes and Pages.

Add the following code to your `main.wasp` file:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
// ...

route LoginRoute { path: "/login", to: LoginPage }
page LoginPage {
  component: import { Login } from "@src/pages/auth"
}
```

We'll define the React components for these pages in the `src/pages/auth.{jsx,tsx}` file below.

#### 6. Creating the Client Pages

:::info
We are using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style the pages. Read more about how to add it [here](../../project/css-frameworks).
:::

Let's create a `auth.{jsx,tsx}` file in the `src/pages` folder and add the following to it:

```tsx title="src/pages/auth.tsx" auto-js

export function Login() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <LoginForm />
    </Layout>
  )
}

// A layout component to center the content
export function Layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="h-full w-full bg-white">
      <div className="flex min-h-[75vh] min-w-full items-center justify-center">
        <div className="h-full w-full max-w-sm bg-white p-5">
          <div>{children}</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

We imported the generated Auth UI components and used them in our pages. Read more about the Auth UI components [here](../../auth/ui).

#### Conclusion

Yay, we've successfully set up Slack Auth! 🎉

![Slack Auth](/img/auth/slack.png)

Running `wasp db migrate-dev` and `wasp start` should now give you a working app with authentication.

### Developing with Slack auth and HTTPS {#slack-https}

Unlike most OAuth providers, Slack **requires HTTPS and publicly accessible URL for the OAuth redirect URL**.
This means that we can't simply use `localhost:3001` as a base host for redirect urls. Instead, we need to configure
Wasp server to be publicly available under HTTPS, even in the local development environment.

Fortunately, there are quite a few free and convenient tools available to simplify the process, such as
[localtunnel.me](https://localtunnel.me/) (free) and [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) (lots of features,
but free tier is limited).

<Collapse title="Using localtunnel">

Install localtunnel globally with `npm install -g localtunnel`. 

Start a tunnel with `lt --port 3001 -s <subdomain>`, where `<subdomain>` is a unique subdomain you would like to have.

:::info Subdomain option

Usually localtunnel will assign you a random subdomain on each start, but you can specify it with the `-s` flag.
Doing it this way will make it easier to remember the URL and will also make it easier to set up the redirect URL
in Slack app settings.

:::

After starting the tunnel, you will see your tunnel URL in the terminal. Go to that URL to unlock the tunnel by entering your IP address
in a field that appears on the page the first time you open it in the browser. This is a basic anti-abuse mechanism. If you're not sure
what your IP is, you can find it by running `curl ifconfig.me` or going to [ifconfig.me](https://ifconfig.me).

Now that your server is exposed to the public, we need to configure Wasp to use the new public domain. This needs to be done in two places:
server and client configuration.

To configure client, add this line to your `.env.client` file (create it if doesn't exist):
```bash title=".env.client"
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://<subdomain>.loca.lt
```

Similarly, to configure the server, add this line to your `.env.server`:
```bash title=".env.server"
WASP_SERVER_URL=https://<subdomain>.loca.lt
```

</Collapse>

### Default Behaviour

Add `slack: {}` to the `auth.methods` dictionary to use it with default settings.

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "My App",
  auth: {
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      // highlight-next-line
      slack: {}
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  },
}
```

<DefaultBehaviour />

### Overrides

#### Data Received From Slack

We are using Slack's API and its `/openid.connect.userInfo` endpoint to get the user data.

The data we receive from Slack on the `/openid.connect.userInfo` endpoint looks something like this:

```json
{
    "ok": true,
    "sub": "U0R7JM",
    "https://slack.com/user_id": "U0R7JM",
    "https://slack.com/team_id": "T0R7GR",
    "email": "krane@slack-corp.com",
    "email_verified": true,
    "date_email_verified": 1622128723,
    "name": "krane",
    "picture": "https://secure.gravatar.com/....png",
    "given_name": "Bront",
    "family_name": "Labradoodle",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "https://slack.com/team_name": "kraneflannel",
    "https://slack.com/team_domain": "kraneflannel",
    "https://slack.com/user_image_24": "...",
    "https://slack.com/user_image_32": "...",
    "https://slack.com/user_image_48": "...",

    "https://slack.com/team_image_230": "...",
    "https://slack.com/team_image_default": true
}
```

The fields you receive depend on the scopes you request. In the example above, the scope includes `email`, `profile` and `openid`. By default, only `openid` is requested. See below for instructions on how to request additional scopes.

## Discord

Wasp supports Discord Authentication out of the box.

Letting your users log in using their Discord accounts turns the signup process into a breeze.

Let's walk through enabling Discord Authentication, explain some of the default settings, and show how to override them.

### Setting up Discord Auth

Enabling Discord Authentication comes down to a series of steps:

1. Enabling Discord authentication in the Wasp file.
2. Adding the `User` entity.
3. Creating a Discord App.
4. Adding the necessary Routes and Pages
5. Using Auth UI components in our Pages.

<WaspFileStructureNote />

#### 1. Adding Discord Auth to Your Wasp File

Let's start by properly configuring the Auth object:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "My App",
  auth: {
    // highlight-next-line
    // 1. Specify the User entity  (we'll define it next)
    // highlight-next-line
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      // highlight-next-line
      // 2. Enable Discord Auth
      // highlight-next-line
      discord: {}
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  },
}
```

#### 2. Add the User Entity

Let's now define the `app.auth.userEntity` entity in the `schema.prisma` file:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
// 3. Define the user entity
model User {
  // highlight-next-line
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  // Add your own fields below
  // ...
}
```

#### 3. Creating a Discord App

To use Discord as an authentication method, you'll first need to create a Discord App and provide Wasp with your client key and secret. Here's how you do it:

1. Log into your Discord account and navigate to: https://discord.com/developers/applications.
2. Select **New Application**.
3. Supply required information.

<img alt="Discord Applications Screenshot" src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations-discord-1.png')} width="400px" />

4. Go to the **OAuth2** tab on the sidebar and click **Add Redirect**

- For development, put: `http://localhost:3001/auth/discord/callback`.
- Once you know on which URL your API server will be deployed, you can create a new app with that URL instead e.g. `https://your-server-url.com/auth/discord/callback`.

4. Hit **Save Changes**.
5. Hit **Reset Secret**.
6. Copy your Client ID and Client secret as you'll need them in the next step.

#### 4. Adding Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to the `.env.server` file at the root of your project (take their values from the previous step):

```bash title=".env.server"
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your-discord-client-id
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your-discord-client-secret
```

#### 5. Adding the Necessary Routes and Pages

Let's define the necessary authentication Routes and Pages.

Add the following code to your `main.wasp` file:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
// ...

route LoginRoute { path: "/login", to: LoginPage }
page LoginPage {
  component: import { Login } from "@src/pages/auth"
}
```

We'll define the React components for these pages in the `src/pages/auth.{jsx,tsx}` file below.

#### 6. Creating the Client Pages

:::info
We are using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style the pages. Read more about how to add it [here](../../project/css-frameworks).
:::

Let's create a `auth.{jsx,tsx}` file in the `src/pages` folder and add the following to it:

```tsx title="src/pages/auth.tsx" auto-js

export function Login() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <LoginForm />
    </Layout>
  )
}

// A layout component to center the content
export function Layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="h-full w-full bg-white">
      <div className="flex min-h-[75vh] min-w-full items-center justify-center">
        <div className="h-full w-full max-w-sm bg-white p-5">
          <div>{children}</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

We imported the generated Auth UI components and used them in our pages. Read more about the Auth UI components [here](../../auth/ui).

#### Conclusion

Yay, we've successfully set up Discord Auth! 🎉

![Discord Auth](/img/auth/discord.png)

Running `wasp db migrate-dev` and `wasp start` should now give you a working app with authentication.
To see how to protect specific pages (i.e., hide them from non-authenticated users), read the docs on [using auth](../../auth/overview).

### Default Behaviour

Add `discord: {}` to the `auth.methods` dictionary to use it with default settings.

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "My App",
  auth: {
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      // highlight-next-line
      discord: {}
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  },
}
```

<DefaultBehaviour />

### Overrides

<OverrideIntro />

#### Data Received From Discord

We are using Discord's API and its `/users/@me` endpoint to get the user data.

The data we receive from Discord on the `/users/@me` endpoint looks something like this:

```json
{
  "id": "80351110224678912",
  "username": "Nelly",
  "discriminator": "1337",
  "avatar": "8342729096ea3675442027381ff50dfe",
  "verified": true,
  "flags": 64,
  "banner": "06c16474723fe537c283b8efa61a30c8",
  "accent_color": 16711680,
  "premium_type": 1,
  "public_flags": 64,
  "avatar_decoration_data": {
    "sku_id": "1144058844004233369",
    "asset": "a_fed43ab12698df65902ba06727e20c0e"
  }
}
```

The fields you receive will depend on the scopes you requested. The default scope is set to `identify` only. If you want to get the email, you need to specify the `email` scope in the `configFn` function.

## Create your own UI for Social Auth

[Auth UI](../ui.md) is a common name for all high-level auth forms that come with Wasp.

These include fully functional auto-generated login and signup forms with working social login buttons.
If you're looking for the fastest way to get your auth up and running, that's where you should look.

The UI helpers described below are lower-level and are useful for creating your custom login links.

Wasp provides sign-in buttons and URLs for each of the supported social login providers.

```tsx title="src/LoginPage.tsx" auto-js

  GoogleSignInButton,
  googleSignInUrl,
  GitHubSignInButton,
  githubSignInUrl,
} from "wasp/client/auth";

export const LoginPage = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <GoogleSignInButton />
      <GitHubSignInButton />
      {/* or */}
      <a href={googleSignInUrl}>Sign in with Google</a>
      <a href={githubSignInUrl}>Sign in with GitHub</a>
    </>
  );
};
```

## Accessing User Data

First, we'll check out the most practical info: **how to access the user's data in your app**.

Then, we'll dive into the details of the **auth entities** that Wasp creates behind the scenes to store the user's data. For auth each method, Wasp needs to store different information about the user. For example, username for [Username & password](./username-and-pass) auth, email verification status for [Email](./email) auth, and so on.

We'll also show you how you can use these entities to create a custom signup action.

### Accessing the Auth Fields

When you receive the `user` object [on the client or the server](../overview.md#accessing-the-logged-in-user), it will contain all the user fields you defined in the `User` entity in the `schema.prisma` file. In addition to that, it will also contain all the auth-related fields that Wasp stores. This includes things like the `username` or the email verification status. In Wasp, this data is called the `AuthUser` object.

#### `AuthUser` Object Fields

All the `User` fields you defined will be present at the top level of the `AuthUser` object. The auth-related fields will be on the `identities` object. For each auth method you enable, there will be a separate data object in the `identities` object.

The `AuthUser` object will change depending on which auth method you have enabled in the Wasp file. For example, if you enabled the email auth and Google auth, it would look something like this:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="google" label="User Signed Up with Google">
    If the user has only the Google identity, the `AuthUser` object will look like this:

    ```ts
    const user = {
      // User data
      id: 'cluqs9qyh00007cn73apj4hp7',
      address: 'Some address',

      // Auth methods specific data
      identities: {
        email: null,
        google: {
          id: '1117XXXX1301972049448',
        },
      },
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="email" label="User Signed Up with Email">
    If the user has only the email identity, the `AuthUser` object will look like this:

    ```ts
    const user = {
      // User data
      id: 'cluqsex9500017cn7i2hwsg17',
      address: 'Some address',

      // Auth methods specific data
      identities: {
        email: {
          id: 'user@app.com',
          isEmailVerified: true,
          emailVerificationSentAt: '2024-04-08T10:06:02.204Z',
          passwordResetSentAt: null,
        },
        google: null,
      },
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the examples above, you can see the `identities` object contains the `email` and `google` objects. The `email` object contains the email-related data and the `google` object contains the Google-related data.

:::info Make sure to check if the data exists

Before accessing some auth method's data, you'll need to check if that data exists for the user and then access it:

```ts
if (user.identities.google !== null) {
  const userId = user.identities.google.id
  // ...
}
```

You need to do this because if a user didn't sign up with some auth method, the data for that auth method will be `null`.
:::

Let's look at the data for each of the available auth methods:

- [Username & password](../username-and-pass.md) data

  <UsernameData />

- [Email](../email.md) data

  <EmailData />

- [Google](../social-auth/google.md) data

  <GoogleData />

- [GitHub](../social-auth/github.md) data

  <GithubData />

- [Keycloak](../social-auth/keycloak.md) data

  <KeycloakData />

- [Discord](../social-auth/discord.md) data

  <DiscordData />

If you support multiple auth methods, you'll need to find which identity exists for the user and then access its data:

```ts
if (user.identities.email !== null) {
  const email = user.identities.email.id
  // ...
} else if (user.identities.google !== null) {
  const googleId = user.identities.google.id
  // ...
}
```

#### `getFirstProviderUserId` Helper

The `getFirstProviderUserId` method returns the first user ID that it finds for the user. For example if the user has signed up with email, it will return the email. If the user has signed up with Google, it will return the Google ID.

This can be useful if you support multiple authentication methods and you need _any_ ID that identifies the user in your app.

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```jsx title="src/MainPage.jsx"
    const MainPage = ({ user }) => {
      const userId = user.getFirstProviderUserId()
      // ...
    }
    ```

    ```js title="src/tasks.js"
    export const createTask = async (args, context) => {
      const userId = context.user.getFirstProviderUserId()
      // ...
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

      // ...
    }
    ```

    ```ts title="src/tasks.ts"
    export const createTask: CreateTask<...>  = async (args, context) => {
      const userId = context.user.getFirstProviderUserId()
      // ...
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<small>
  \* Multiple identities per user will be possible in the future and then the `getFirstProviderUserId` method will return the ID of the first identity that it finds without any guarantees about which one it will be.
</small>

### Including the User with Other Entities

Sometimes, you might want to include the user's data when fetching other entities. For example, you might want to include the user's data with the tasks they have created.

We'll mention the `auth` and the `identities` relations which we will explain in more detail later in the [Entities Explained](#entities-explained) section.

:::caution Be careful about sensitive data

You'll need to include the `auth` and the `identities` relations to get the full auth data about the user. However, you should keep in mind that the `providerData` field in the `identities` can contain sensitive data like the user's hashed password (in case of email or username auth), so you will likely want to exclude it if you are returning those values to the client.

:::

You can include the full user's data with other entities using the `include` option in the Prisma queries:

    export const getAllTasks = async (args, context) => {

        },
      })
    }) satisfies tasks.GetAllQuery<{}, {}>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you have some **piece of the auth data that you want to access frequently** (for example the `username`), it's best to store it at the top level of the `User` entity.

For example, save the `username` or `email` as a property on the `User` and you'll be able to access it without including the `auth` and `identities` fields. We show an example in the [Defining Extra Fields on the User Entity](../overview.md#1-defining-extra-fields) section of the docs.

#### Getting Auth Data from the User Object

When you have the `user` object with the `auth` and `identities` fields, it can be a bit tedious to obtain the auth data (like username or Google ID) from it:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

    function MainPage() {
      // ...

          {tasks.map((task) => (
            <div key={task.id} className="task">
              {task.title} by {task.user.auth?.identities[0].providerUserId}
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

      // ...
      return (
        <div className="tasks">
          {tasks.map((task) => (
            <div key={task.id} className="task">
              {task.title} by {task.user.auth?.identities[0].providerUserId}
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Wasp offers a few helper methods to access the user's auth data when you retrieve the `user` like this. They are `getUsername`, `getEmail` and `getFirstProviderUserId`. They can be used both on the client and the server.

##### `getUsername`

It accepts the `user` object and if the user signed up with the [Username & password](./username-and-pass) auth method, it returns the username or `null` otherwise. The `user` object needs to have the `auth` and the `identities` relations included.

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```jsx title="src/MainPage.jsx"
    import { getUsername } from 'wasp/auth'

    function MainPage() {
      // ...
      return (
        <div className="tasks">
          {tasks.map((task) => (
            <div key={task.id} className="task">
              {task.title} by {getUsername(task.user)}
            </div>

##### `getEmail`

It accepts the `user` object and if the user signed up with the [Email](./email) auth method, it returns the email or `null` otherwise. The `user` object needs to have the `auth` and the `identities` relations included.

### Entities Explained

To store user's auth information, Wasp does a few things behind the scenes. Wasp takes your `schema.prisma` file and combines it with additional entities to create the final `schema.prisma` file that is used in your app.

In this section, we will explain which entities are created and how they are connected.

#### User Entity

When you want to add authentication to your app, you need to specify the `userEntity` field.

For example, you might set it to `User`:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "My App",
  auth: {
    // highlight-next-line
    userEntity: User,
    // ...
  },
}
```

And define the `User` in the `schema.prisma` file:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
model User {
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  // Any other fields you want to store about the user
}
```

The `User` entity is a "business logic user" which represents a user of your app.

You can use this entity to store any information about the user that you want to store. For example, you might want to store the user's name or address.

You can also use the user entity to define the relations between users and other entities in your app. For example, you might want to define a relation between a user and the tasks that they have created.

You **own** the user entity and you can modify it as you wish. You can add new fields to it, remove fields from it, or change the type of the fields. You can also add new relations to it or remove existing relations from it.

<ImgWithCaption alt="Auth Entities in a Wasp App" source="img/auth-entities/model.png" caption="Auth Entities in a Wasp App" />

On the other hand, the `Auth`, `AuthIdentity` and `Session` entities are created behind the scenes and are used to store the user's login credentials. You as the developer don't need to care about this entity most of the time. Wasp **owns** these entities.

In the case you want to create a custom signup action, you will need to use the `Auth` and `AuthIdentity` entities directly.

#### Example App Model

Let's imagine we created a simple tasks management app:

- The app has email and Google-based auth.
- Users can create tasks and see the tasks that they have created.

Let's look at how would that look in the database:

<ImgWithCaption alt="Example of Auth Entities" source="img/auth-entities/model-example.png" caption="Example of Auth Entities" />

If we take a look at an example user in the database, we can see:

- The business logic user, `User` is connected to multiple `Task` entities.
  - In this example, "Example User" has two tasks.
- The `User` is connected to exactly one `Auth` entity.
- Each `Auth` entity can have multiple `AuthIdentity` entities.
  - In this example, the `Auth` entity has two `AuthIdentity` entities: one for the email-based auth and one for the Google-based auth.
- Each `Auth` entity can have multiple `Session` entities.
  - In this example, the `Auth` entity has one `Session` entity.

<MultipleIdentitiesWarning />

#### `Auth` Entity Internal!

Wasp's internal `Auth` entity is used to connect the business logic user, `User` with the user's login credentials.

```prisma
model Auth {
  id         String         @id @default(uuid())
  userId     Int?           @unique
  // Wasp injects this relation on the User entity as well
  user       User?          @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  identities AuthIdentity[]
  sessions   Session[]
}
```

The `Auth` fields:

- `id` is a unique identifier of the `Auth` entity.
- `userId` is a foreign key to the `User` entity.
  - It is used to connect the `Auth` entity with the business logic user.
- `user` is a relation to the `User` entity.
  - This relation is injected on the `User` entity as well.
- `identities` is a relation to the `AuthIdentity` entity.
- `sessions` is a relation to the `Session` entity.

#### `AuthIdentity` Entity Internal!

The `AuthIdentity` entity is used to store the user's login credentials for various authentication methods.

```prisma
model AuthIdentity {
  providerName   String
  providerUserId String
  providerData   String @default("{}")
  authId         String
  auth           Auth   @relation(fields: [authId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@id([providerName, providerUserId])
}
```

The `AuthIdentity` fields:

- `providerName` is the name of the authentication provider.
  - For example, `email` or `google`.
- `providerUserId` is the user's ID in the authentication provider.
  - For example, the user's email or Google ID.
- `providerData` is a JSON string that contains additional data about the user from the authentication provider.
  - For example, for password based auth, this field contains the user's hashed password.
  - This field is a `String` and not a `Json` type because [Prisma doesn't support the `Json` type for SQLite](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3786).
- `authId` is a foreign key to the `Auth` entity.
  - It is used to connect the `AuthIdentity` entity with the `Auth` entity.
- `auth` is a relation to the `Auth` entity.

#### `Session` Entity Internal!

The `Session` entity is used to store the user's session information. It is used to keep the user logged in between page refreshes.

```prisma
model Session {
  id        String   @id @unique
  expiresAt DateTime
  userId    String
  auth      Auth     @relation(references: [id], fields: [userId], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@index([userId])
}
```

The `Session` fields:

- `id` is a unique identifier of the `Session` entity.
- `expiresAt` is the date when the session expires.
- `userId` is a foreign key to the `Auth` entity.
  - It is used to connect the `Session` entity with the `Auth` entity.
- `auth` is a relation to the `Auth` entity.

### Custom Signup Action

Let's take a look at how you can use the `Auth` and `AuthIdentity` entities to create custom login and signup actions. For example, you might want to create a custom signup action that creates a user in your app and also creates a user in a third-party service.

:::info Custom Signup Examples

In the Advanced section you can see an example for [Email](../advanced/custom-auth-actions.md#email) or [Username and password](../advanced/custom-auth-actions.md#username-and-password) authentication.

:::

Below is a simplified version of a custom signup action which you probably wouldn't use in your app but it shows you how you can use the `Auth` and `AuthIdentity` entities to create a custom signup action.

        success: true,
        message: 'User created successfully',
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can use whichever method suits your needs better: either the `createUser` function or Prisma's `User.create` method. The `createUser` function is a bit more convenient to use because it hides some of the complexity. On the other hand, the `User.create` method gives you more control over the data that is stored in the `Auth` and `AuthIdentity` entities.

## Auth Hooks

Auth hooks allow you to "hook into" the auth process at various stages and run your custom code. For example, if you want to forbid certain emails from signing up, or if you wish to send a welcome email to the user after they sign up, auth hooks are the way to go.

### Supported hooks

The following auth hooks are available in Wasp:

- [`onBeforeSignup`](#executing-code-before-the-user-signs-up)
- [`onAfterSignup`](#executing-code-after-the-user-signs-up)
- [`onAfterEmailVerified`](#executing-code-after-a-user-verifies-their-email)
- [`onBeforeOAuthRedirect`](#executing-code-before-the-oauth-redirect)
- [`onBeforeLogin`](#executing-code-before-the-user-logs-in)
- [`onAfterLogin`](#executing-code-after-the-user-logs-in)

We'll go through each of these hooks in detail. But first, let's see how the hooks fit into the auth flows:

<ImgWithCaption source="/img/auth-hooks/signup_flow_with_hooks.png" alt="Signup Flow with Hooks" caption="Signup Flow with Hooks" />

<ImgWithCaption source="/img/auth-hooks/login_flow_with_hooks.png" alt="Login Flow with Hooks" caption="Login Flow with Hooks *" />

<small>
  \* When using the OAuth auth providers, the login hooks are both called before the session is created but the session is created quickly afterward, so it shouldn't make any difference in practice.
</small>

Users registering with [email](./email.md) must verify it before they can log in. This verification triggers the Email verification flow:

<ImgWithCaption
  source="/img/auth-hooks/email_verification_flow_with_hooks.png"
  alt="Email Verification Flow with Hooks"
  caption="Email Verification Flow with Hooks"
/>

Users signing in with [OAuth](./social-auth/overview.md) must authorize access before completing login. This authorization triggers the OAuth consent flow:

<ImgWithCaption source="/img/auth-hooks/oauth_flow_with_hooks.png" alt="OAuth Flow with Hooks" caption="OAuth Flow with Hooks" />

### Using hooks

To use auth hooks, you must first declare them in the Wasp file:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp
    app myApp {
      wasp: {
        version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
      },
      auth: {
        userEntity: User,
        methods: {
          ...
        },
        onBeforeSignup: import { onBeforeSignup } from "@src/auth/hooks",
        onAfterSignup: import { onAfterSignup } from "@src/auth/hooks",
        onAfterEmailVerified: import { onAfterEmailVerified } from "@src/auth/hooks",
        onBeforeOAuthRedirect: import { onBeforeOAuthRedirect } from "@src/auth/hooks",
        onBeforeLogin: import { onBeforeLogin } from "@src/auth/hooks",
        onAfterLogin: import { onAfterLogin } from "@src/auth/hooks",
      },
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp
    app myApp {
      wasp: {
        version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
      },
      auth: {
        userEntity: User,
        methods: {
          ...
        },
        onBeforeSignup: import { onBeforeSignup } from "@src/auth/hooks",
        onAfterSignup: import { onAfterSignup } from "@src/auth/hooks",
        onAfterEmailVerified: import { onAfterEmailVerified } from "@src/auth/hooks",
        onBeforeOAuthRedirect: import { onBeforeOAuthRedirect } from "@src/auth/hooks",
        onBeforeLogin: import { onBeforeLogin } from "@src/auth/hooks",
        onAfterLogin: import { onAfterLogin } from "@src/auth/hooks",
      },
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If the hooks are defined as async functions, Wasp _awaits_ them. This means the auth process waits for the hooks to finish before continuing.

Wasp ignores the hooks' return values. The only exception is the `onBeforeOAuthRedirect` hook, whose return value affects the OAuth redirect URL.

We'll now go through each of the available hooks.

#### Executing code before the user signs up

Wasp calls the `onBeforeSignup` hook before the user is created.

The `onBeforeSignup` hook can be useful if you want to reject a user based on some criteria before they sign up.

Read more about the data the `onBeforeSignup` hook receives in the [API Reference](#the-onbeforesignup-hook).

#### Executing code after the user signs up

Wasp calls the `onAfterSignup` hook after the user is created.

The `onAfterSignup` hook can be useful if you want to send the user a welcome email or perform some other action after the user signs up like syncing the user with a third-party service.

Since the `onAfterSignup` hook receives the OAuth tokens, you can use this hook to store the OAuth access token and/or [refresh token](#refreshing-the-oauth-access-token) in your database.

#### Executing code after a user verifies their email

Wasp calls the `onAfterEmailVerified` hook exactly once, after the user verifies their email.

The `onAfterEmailVerified` hook is useful for triggering actions in response to the verification event — such as sending a welcome email or syncing user data with a third-party service.

The `onAfterEmailVerified` hook receives an `email` string and `user` object, this makes it easy to perform personalized actions upon email verification.

#### Executing code before the OAuth redirect

Wasp calls the `onBeforeOAuthRedirect` hook after the OAuth redirect URL is generated but before redirecting the user. This hook can access the request object sent from the client at the start of the OAuth process.

The `onBeforeOAuthRedirect` hook can be useful if you want to save some data (e.g. request query parameters) that you can use later in the OAuth flow. You can use the `uniqueRequestId` parameter to reference this data later in the `onAfterSignup` or `onAfterLogin` hooks.

#### Refreshing the OAuth access token

Some OAuth providers support refreshing the access token when it expires. To refresh the access token, you need the OAuth **refresh token**.

Wasp exposes the OAuth refresh token in the `onAfterSignup` and `onAfterLogin` hooks. You can store the refresh token in your database and use it to refresh the access token when it expires.

Import the provider object with the OAuth client from the `wasp/server/auth` module. For example, to refresh the Google OAuth access token, import the `google` object from the `wasp/server/auth` module. You use the `refreshAccessToken` method of the OAuth client to refresh the access token.

Here's an example of how you can refresh the access token for Google OAuth:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/auth/hooks.js"
    import { google } from 'wasp/server/auth'

    export const onAfterLogin = async ({ oauth }) => {
      if (oauth.provider === 'google' && oauth.tokens.refreshToken !== null) {
        const newTokens = await google.oAuthClient.refreshAccessToken(
          oauth.tokens.refreshToken
        )
        log('new tokens', newTokens)
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/auth/hooks.ts"
    import type { OnAfterLoginHook } from 'wasp/server/auth'
    import { google } from 'wasp/server/auth'

    export const onAfterLogin: OnAfterLoginHook = async ({ oauth }) => {
      if (oauth.provider === 'google' && oauth.tokens.refreshToken !== null) {
        const newTokens = await google.oAuthClient.refreshAccessToken(
          oauth.tokens.refreshToken
        )
        log('new tokens', newTokens)
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Google exposes the `accessTokenExpiresAt` field in the `oauth.tokens` object. You can use this field to determine when the access token expires.

If you want to refresh the token periodically, use a [Wasp Job](../advanced/jobs.md).

#### ProviderId fields

The `providerId` object represents the user for the current authentication method. Wasp passes it to the `onBeforeSignup`, `onAfterSignup`, `onBeforeLogin`, and `onAfterLogin` hooks.

It has the following fields:

- `providerName: string`

  The provider's name (e.g. `'email'`, `'google'`, `'github`)

- `providerUserId: string`

  The user's unique ID in the provider's system (e.g. email, Google ID, GitHub ID)

#### OAuth fields

Wasp passes the `oauth` object to the `onAfterSignup` and `onAfterLogin` hooks only when the user is authenticated with [Social Auth](./social-auth/overview.md).

It has the following fields:

- `providerName: string`

  The name of the OAuth provider the user authenticated with (e.g. `'google'`, `'github'`).

- `tokens: Tokens`

  You can use the OAuth tokens to make requests to the provider's API on the user's behalf.

  Depending on the OAuth provider, the `tokens` object might have different fields. For example, Google has the fields `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `idToken`, and `accessTokenExpiresAt`.

  <ShowForTs>
    To access the provider-specific fields, you must first narrow down the `oauth.tokens` object type to the specific OAuth provider type.

    ```ts
    if (oauth && oauth.providerName === 'google') {
      console.log(oauth.tokens.accessToken)
      //                  ^ Google specific tokens are available here
      console.log(oauth.tokens.refreshToken)
      console.log(oauth.tokens.idToken)
      console.log(oauth.tokens.accessTokenExpiresAt)
    }
    ```
  </ShowForTs>

- `uniqueRequestId: string`

  The unique request ID for the OAuth flow (you might know it as the `state` parameter in OAuth.)

  You can use the unique request ID to get the data that was saved in the `onBeforeOAuthRedirect` hook.

## custom-auth-actions

## Custom sign-up actions

If you need to deeply hook into the sign-up process, you can create your own sign-up action and customize the code to, for example, add extra validation, store more data, or otherwise call custom code at registration time.

:::danger

Custom sign-up actions are complex, and we don't recommend creating a custom sign-up action unless you have a good reason to do so.
They also require you to be careful, as any small mistake will compromise the security of your app.

Before using custom actions, check if our support for [custom auth UI](../overview.md#custom-auth-ui) and for [auth hooks](../auth-hooks.md) could fit well with you requirements.

:::

You are not able to use Wasp UI with custom sign-up actions, so you're expected to implemented your own UI and call the custom actions you create from it.

### Example code

Below you will find a starting point for creating your own actions. The given implementation is similar to what Wasp does under the hood, and it is up to you to customize it.

### Validators API Reference

We suggest using the built-in field validators for your authentication flow. You can import them from `wasp/server/auth`. These are the same validators that Wasp uses internally for the default authentication flow.

##### Username

- `ensureValidUsername(args)`

  Checks if the username is valid and throws an error if it's not. Read more about the validation rules [here](../overview.md#default-validations).

##### Email

- `ensureValidEmail(args)`

  Checks if the email is valid and throws an error if it's not. Read more about the validation rules [here](../overview.md#default-validations).

##### Password

- `ensurePasswordIsPresent(args)`

  Checks if the password is present and throws an error if it's not.

- `ensureValidPassword(args)`

  Checks if the password is valid and throws an error if it's not. Read more about the validation rules [here](../overview.md#default-validations).

**Features:** Generated using OpenAI's GPT models, Auth (username/password), Queries, Actions, Pages, Full-stack Type Safety

## Customizing the App

Each Wasp project can have only one `app` type declaration. It is used to configure your app and its components.

```wasp
app todoApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "ToDo App",
  head: [
    "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500&display=swap\" />"
  ]
}
```

We'll go through some common customizations you might want to do to your app. For more details on each of the fields, check out the [API Reference](#api-reference).

#### Changing the App Title

You may want to change the title of your app, which appears in the browser tab, next to the favicon. You can change it by changing the `title` field of your `app` declaration:

```wasp
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "BookFace"
}
```

#### Adding Additional Lines to the Head

If you are looking to add additional style sheets or scripts to your app, you can do so by adding them to the `head` field of your `app` declaration.

An example of adding extra style sheets and scripts:

```wasp
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "My App",
  head: [  // optional
    "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500&display=swap\" />",
    "<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/2.9.3/Chart.min.js\"></script>",
    "<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1, width=device-width\" />"
  ]
}
```

### API Reference

```wasp
app todoApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "{latestWaspVersion}"
  },
  title: "ToDo App",
  head: [
    "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500&display=swap\" />"
  ],
  auth: {
    // ...
  },
  client: {
    // ...
  },
  server: {
    // ...
  },
  db: {
    // ...
  },
  emailSender: {
    // ...
  },
  webSocket: {
    // ...
  }
}
```

The `app` declaration has the following fields:

- `wasp: dict` Required!
  Wasp compiler configuration. It is a dictionary with a single field:

  - `version: string` Required!

    The version specifies which versions of Wasp are compatible with the app. It should contain a valid [SemVer range](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#ranges)

    :::info
    For now, the version field only supports caret ranges (i.e., `^x.y.z`). Support for the full specification will come in a future version of Wasp
    :::

- `title: string` Required!

  Title of your app. It will appear in the browser tab, next to the favicon.

- `head: [string]`

  List of additional lines (e.g. `<link>` or `<script>` tags) to be included in the `<head>` of your HTML document.

The rest of the fields are covered in dedicated sections of the docs:

- `auth: dict`

  Authentication configuration. Read more in the [authentication section](../auth/overview) of the docs.

- `client: dict`

  Configuration for the client side of your app. Read more in the [client configuration section](../project/client-config) of the docs.

- `server: dict`

  Configuration for the server side of your app. Read more in the [server configuration section](../project/server-config) of the docs.

- `db: dict`

  Database configuration. Read more in the [database configuration section](../data-model/databases.md) of the docs.

- `emailSender: dict`

  Email sender configuration. Read more in the [email sending section](../advanced/email) of the docs.

- `webSocket: dict`

  WebSocket configuration. Read more in the [WebSocket section](../advanced/web-sockets) of the docs.

## Client Config

You can configure the client using the `client` field inside the `app` declaration:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app MyApp {
      title: "My app",
      // ...
      client: {
        rootComponent: import Root from "@src/Root.jsx",
        setupFn: import mySetupFunction from "@src/myClientSetupCode.js"
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app MyApp {
      title: "My app",
      // ...
      client: {
        rootComponent: import Root from "@src/Root.tsx",
        setupFn: import mySetupFunction from "@src/myClientSetupCode.ts"
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Root Component

Wasp gives you the option to define a "wrapper" component for your React app.

It can be used for a variety of purposes, but the most common ones are:

- Defining a common layout for your application.
- Setting up various providers that your application needs.

#### Defining a Common Layout

Let's define a common layout for your application:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app MyApp {
      title: "My app",
      // ...
      client: {
        rootComponent: import Root from "@src/Root.jsx",
      }
    }
    ```

    ```jsx title="src/Root.jsx"
    import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom'

    export default function Root() {
      return (
        <div>
          <header>
            <h1>My App</h1>
          </header>
          // highlight-next-line
          <Outlet />
          <footer>
            <p>My App footer</p>
          </footer>
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app MyApp {
      title: "My app",
      // ...
      client: {
        rootComponent: import Root from "@src/Root.tsx",
      }
    }
    ```

    ```tsx title="src/Root.tsx"
    import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom'

    export default function Root() {
      return (
        <div>
          <header>
            <h1>My App</h1>
          </header>
          // highlight-next-line
          <Outlet />
          <footer>
            <p>My App footer</p>
          </footer>
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You need to import the [`Outlet`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/outlet#outlet) component from `react-router-dom` and put it where you want the current page to be rendered.

#### Setting up a Provider

This is how to set up various providers that your application needs:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app MyApp {
      title: "My app",
      // ...
      client: {
        rootComponent: import Root from "@src/Root.jsx",
      }
    }
    ```

    ```jsx title="src/Root.jsx"
    import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom'
    import store from './store'
    import { Provider } from 'react-redux'

    export default function Root() {
      return (
        <Provider store={store}>
          <Outlet />
        </Provider>
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app MyApp {
      title: "My app",
      // ...
      client: {
        rootComponent: import Root from "@src/Root.tsx",
      }
    }
    ```

    ```tsx title="src/Root.tsx"
    import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom'
    import store from './store'
    import { Provider } from 'react-redux'

    export default function Root() {
      return (
        <Provider store={store}>
          <Outlet />
        </Provider>
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

As long as you render the `Outlet` component, you can put what ever you want in the root component.

Read more about the root component in the [API Reference](#rootcomponent-extimport).

### Setup Function

`setupFn` declares a <ShowForTs>Typescript</ShowForTs><ShowForJs>JavaScript</ShowForJs> function that Wasp executes on the client before everything else.

#### Running Some Code

We can run any code we want in the setup function.

For example, here's a setup function that logs a message every hour:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/myClientSetupCode.js"
    export default async function mySetupFunction() {
      let count = 1
      setInterval(
        () => console.log(`You have been online for ${count++} hours.`),
        1000 * 60 * 60
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/myClientSetupCode.ts"
    export default async function mySetupFunction(): Promise<void> {
      let count = 1
      setInterval(
        () => console.log(`You have been online for ${count++} hours.`),
        1000 * 60 * 60
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Overriding Default Behaviour for Queries

:::info
You can change the options for a **single** Query using the `options` object, as described [here](../data-model/operations/queries#the-usequery-hook-1).
:::

Wasp's `useQuery` hook uses `react-query`'s `useQuery` hook under the hood. Since `react-query` comes configured with aggressive but sane default options, you most likely won't have to change those defaults for all Queries.

If you do need to change the global defaults, you can do so inside the client setup function.

Wasp exposes a `configureQueryClient` hook that lets you configure _react-query_'s `QueryClient` object:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/myClientSetupCode.js"
    import { configureQueryClient } from 'wasp/client/operations'

    export default async function mySetupFunction() {
      // ... some setup
      configureQueryClient({
        defaultOptions: {
          queries: {
            staleTime: Infinity,
          },
        },
      })
      // ... some more setup
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/myClientSetupCode.ts"
    import { configureQueryClient } from 'wasp/client/operations'

    export default async function mySetupFunction(): Promise<void> {
      // ... some setup
      configureQueryClient({
        defaultOptions: {
          queries: {
            staleTime: Infinity,
          },
        },
      })
      // ... some more setup
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Make sure to pass in an object expected by the `QueryClient`'s constructor, as
explained in
[react-query's docs](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/reference/QueryClient).

Read more about the setup function in the [API Reference](#setupfn-extimport).

### Base Directory

If you need to serve the client from a subdirectory, you can use the `baseDir` option:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app MyApp {
  title: "My app",
  // ...
  client: {
    baseDir: "/my-app",
  }
}
```

This means that if you serve your app from `https://example.com/my-app`, the
router will work correctly, and all the assets will be served from
`https://example.com/my-app`.

<BaseDirEnvNote />

### API Reference

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app MyApp {
      title: "My app",
      // ...
      client: {
        rootComponent: import Root from "@src/Root.jsx",
        setupFn: import mySetupFunction from "@src/myClientSetupCode.js"
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app MyApp {
      title: "My app",
      // ...
      client: {
        rootComponent: import Root from "@src/Root.tsx",
        setupFn: import mySetupFunction from "@src/myClientSetupCode.ts",
        baseDir: "/my-app",
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Client has the following options:

- #### `rootComponent: ExtImport`

  `rootComponent` defines the root component of your client application. It is
  expected to be a React component, and Wasp will use it as the root of the
  client application.
  It must render the `Outlet` component from `react-router-dom` to render the
  current page.

  Here's an example of a root component that both sets up a provider and
  renders a custom layout:

  <Tabs groupId="js-ts">
    <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
      ```jsx title="src/Root.jsx"
      import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom'
      import store from './store'
      import { Provider } from 'react-redux'

      export default function Root() {
        return (
          <Provider store={store}>
            <Layout />
          </Provider>
        )
      }

      function Layout() {
        return (
          <div>
            <header>
              <h1>My App</h1>
            </header>
            // highlight-next-line
            <Outlet />
            <footer>
              <p>My App footer</p>
            </footer>
          </div>
        )
      }
      ```
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
      ```tsx title="src/Root.tsx"

      export default function Root() {
        return (
          <Provider store={store}>
            <Layout />
          </Provider>
        )
      }

      function Layout() {
        return (
          <div>
            <header>
              <h1>My App</h1>
            </header>
            // highlight-next-line

          </div>
        )
      }
      ```
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

- #### `setupFn: ExtImport`

  <ShowForTs>
    `setupFn` declares a Typescript function that Wasp executes on the client
    before everything else. It is expected to be asynchronous, and
    Wasp will await its completion before rendering the page. The function takes no
    arguments, and its return value is ignored.
  </ShowForTs>

  <ShowForJs>
    `setupFn` declares a JavaScript function that Wasp executes on the client
    before everything else. It is expected to be asynchronous, and
    Wasp will await its completion before rendering the page. The function takes no
    arguments, and its return value is ignored.
  </ShowForJs>

  You can use this function to perform any custom setup (e.g., setting up
  client-side periodic jobs).

  <Tabs groupId="js-ts">
    <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
      ```js title="src/myClientSetupCode.js"
      export default async function mySetupFunction() {
        // Run some code
      }
      ```
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
      ```ts title="src/myClientSetupCode.ts"
      export default async function mySetupFunction(): Promise<void> {
        // Run some code
      }
      ```
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

- #### `baseDir: String`

  If you need to serve the client from a subdirectory, you can use the `baseDir` option.

  If you set `baseDir` to `/my-app` for example, that will make Wasp set the `basename` prop of the `Router` to
  `/my-app`. It will also set the `base` option of the Vite config to `/my-app`.

  This means that if you serve your app from `https://example.com/my-app`, the router will work correctly, and all the assets will be served from `https://example.com/my-app`.

  <BaseDirEnvNote />

## Server Config

You can configure the behavior of the server via the `server` field of `app` declaration:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app MyApp {
      title: "My app",
      // ...
      server: {
        setupFn: import { mySetupFunction } from "@src/myServerSetupCode.js",
        middlewareConfigFn: import { myMiddlewareConfigFn } from "@src/myServerSetupCode.js"
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app MyApp {
      title: "My app",
      // ...
      server: {
        setupFn: import { mySetupFunction } from "@src/myServerSetupCode.js",
        middlewareConfigFn: import { myMiddlewareConfigFn } from "@src/myServerSetupCode.js"
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Setup Function

<ShowForTs>
  `setupFn` declares a Typescript function that will be executed on server start.
</ShowForTs>

<ShowForJs>
  `setupFn` declares a Javascript function that will be executed on server start.
</ShowForJs>

#### Adding a Custom Route

As an example, adding a custom route would look something like:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/myServerSetupCode.ts"
    export const mySetupFunction = async ({ app }) => {
      addCustomRoute(app)
    }

    function addCustomRoute(app) {
      app.get('/customRoute', (_req, res) => {
        res.send('I am a custom route')
      })
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/myServerSetupCode.ts"
    import { ServerSetupFn } from 'wasp/server'
    import { Application } from 'express'

    export const mySetupFunction: ServerSetupFn = async ({ app }) => {
      addCustomRoute(app)
    }

    function addCustomRoute(app: Application) {
      app.get('/customRoute', (_req, res) => {
        res.send('I am a custom route')
      })
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Storing Some Values for Later Use

In case you want to store some values for later use, or to be accessed by the [Operations](../data-model/operations/overview) you do that in the `setupFn` function.

Dummy example of such function and its usage:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/myServerSetupCode.js"
    let someResource = undefined

    export const mySetupFunction = async () => {
      // Let's pretend functions setUpSomeResource and startSomeCronJob
      // are implemented below or imported from another file.
      someResource = await setUpSomeResource()
      startSomeCronJob()
    }

    export const getSomeResource = () => someResource
    ```

    ```js title="src/queries.js"
    import { getSomeResource } from './myServerSetupCode.js'

    ...

    export const someQuery = async (args, context) => {
      const someResource = getSomeResource()
      return queryDataFromSomeResource(args, someResource)
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/myServerSetupCode.ts"
    import { type ServerSetupFn } from 'wasp/server'

    let someResource = undefined

    export const mySetupFunction: ServerSetupFn = async () => {
      // Let's pretend functions setUpSomeResource and startSomeCronJob
      // are implemented below or imported from another file.
      someResource = await setUpSomeResource()
      startSomeCronJob()  
    }

    export const getSomeResource = () => someResource
    ```

    ```ts title="src/queries.ts"
    import { type SomeQuery } from 'wasp/server/operations'
    import { getSomeResource } from './myServerSetupCode.js'

    ...

    export const someQuery: SomeQuery<...> = async (args, context) => {
      const someResource = getSomeResource()
      return queryDataFromSomeResource(args, someResource)
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
The recommended way is to put the variable in the same module where you defined the setup function and then expose additional functions for reading those values, which you can then import directly from Operations and use.

This effectively turns your module into a singleton whose construction is performed on server start.

### Middleware Config Function

You can configure the global middleware via the `middlewareConfigFn`. This will modify the middleware stack for all operations and APIs.

Read more about [middleware config function](#middlewareconfigfn-extimport) below.

### API Reference

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app MyApp {
      title: "My app",
      // ...
      server: {
        setupFn: import { mySetupFunction } from "@src/myServerSetupCode.js",
        middlewareConfigFn: import { myMiddlewareConfigFn } from "@src/myServerSetupCode.js"
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"

      title: "My app",
      // ...
      server: {
        setupFn: import { mySetupFunction } from "@src/myServerSetupCode.js",
        middlewareConfigFn: import { myMiddlewareConfigFn } from "@src/myServerSetupCode.js"
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

`app.server` is a dictionary with the following fields:

- #### `setupFn: ExtImport`

  `setupFn` declares a <ShowForTs>Typescript</ShowForTs><ShowForJs>Javascript</ShowForJs> function that will be executed on server start. This function is expected to be async and will be awaited before the server starts accepting any requests.

  It allows you to do any custom setup, e.g. setting up additional database/websockets or starting cron/scheduled jobs.

  The `setupFn` function receives the `express.Application` and the `http.Server` instances as part of its context. They can be useful for setting up any custom server logic.

  <Tabs groupId="js-ts">
    <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
      ```js title="src/myServerSetupCode.js"
      export const mySetupFunction = async () => {
        await setUpSomeResource()
      }
      ```
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
      Types for the setup function and its context are as follows:

      ```ts title="wasp/server"
      export type ServerSetupFn = (context: ServerSetupFnContext) => Promise<void>

      export type ServerSetupFnContext = {
        app: Application // === express.Application
        server: Server // === http.Server
      }
      ```

      ```ts title="src/myServerSetupCode.ts"
      import { type ServerSetupFn } from 'wasp/server'

      export const mySetupFunction: ServerSetupFn = async () => {
        await setUpSomeResource()
      }
      ```
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

- #### `middlewareConfigFn: ExtImport`

  The import statement to an Express middleware config function. This is a global modification affecting all operations and APIs. See more in the [configuring middleware section](../advanced/middleware-config#1-customize-global-middleware).

## Static Asset Handling

### Importing an Asset as URL

Importing a static asset (e.g. an image) will return its URL. For example:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```jsx title="src/App.jsx"
    import imgUrl from './img.png'

    function App() {
      return <img src={imgUrl} alt="img" />
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```jsx title="src/App.tsx"
    import imgUrl from './img.png'

    function App() {
      return <img src={imgUrl} alt="img" />
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

For example, `imgUrl` will be `/img.png` during development, and become `/assets/img.2d8efhg.png` in the production build.

This is what you want to use most of the time, as it ensures that the asset file exists and is included in the bundle.

We are using Vite under the hood, read more about importing static assets in Vite's [docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#importing-asset-as-url).

### The `public` Directory

If you have assets that are:

- Never referenced in source code (e.g. robots.txt)
- Must retain the exact same file name (without hashing)
- ...or you simply don't want to have to import an asset first just to get its URL

Then you can place the asset in the `public` directory at the root of your project:

```
.
└── public
    ├── favicon.ico
    └── robots.txt
```

Assets in this directory will be served at root path `/` during development and copied to the root of the dist directory as-is.

For example, if you have a file `favicon.ico` in the `public` directory, and your app is hosted at `https://myapp.com`, it will be made available at `https://myapp.com/favicon.ico`.

:::info Usage in client code
Note that:

- You should always reference public assets using root absolute path
  - for example, `public/icon.png` should be referenced in source code as `/icon.png`.
- Assets in the `public` directory **cannot be imported** from <ShowForJs>JavaScript</ShowForJs><ShowForTs>TypeScript</ShowForTs>.
  :::

## Env Variables

**Environment variables** are used to configure projects based on the context in which they run. This allows them to exhibit different behaviors in different environments, such as development, staging, or production.

For instance, _during development_, you may want your project to connect to a local development database running on your machine, but _in production_, you want it to connect to the production database. Similarly, in development, you may want to use a test Stripe account, while in production, your app should use a real Stripe account.

While some env vars are required by Wasp, such as the database connection or secrets for social auth, you can also define your env vars for any other useful purposes, and then access them in the code.

Let's go over the available env vars in Wasp, how to define them, and how to use them in your project.

### Client Env Vars {#client-env-vars}

Client environment variables are injected into the client Javascript code during the build process, making them public and readable by anyone. Therefore, you should **never store secrets in them** (such as secret API keys, you should store secrets in the server env variables).

<ClientEnvVarsNote />

You can read them from the client code like this:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/App.js"
    import { env } from 'wasp/client'

    console.log(env.REACT_APP_SOME_VAR_NAME)
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/App.ts"
    import { env } from 'wasp/client'

    console.log(env.REACT_APP_SOME_VAR_NAME)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Read more about the `env` object in the [API reference](#client-env-vars-api).

#### Wasp Client Env Vars

Here are the client env vars that Wasp defines:

##### General Configuration {#client-general-configuration}

These are some general env variables used for various Wasp features:

<EnvVarsTable
  envVars={[
{ name: "REACT_APP_API_URL", type: "URL", isRequired: false, defaultValue: "http://localhost:3001", note: "The client uses this as the server URL." }
]}
/>

### Server Env Vars

You can store secret values (e.g. secret API keys) in the server env variables since they are not publicly readable. You can define them without any special prefix, such as `SOME_VAR_NAME=...`.

You can read the env vars from server code like this:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js
    import { env } from 'wasp/server'

    console.log(env.SOME_VAR_NAME)
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts
    import { env } from 'wasp/server'

    console.log(env.SOME_VAR_NAME)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Read more about the `env` object in the [API reference](#server-env-vars-1).

#### Wasp Server Env Vars

##### General Configuration {#server-general-configuration}

These are some general env variables used for various Wasp features:

<EnvVarsTable
  envVars={[
{ name: "DATABASE_URL", type: "String", isRequired: true, note: "The URL of the PostgreSQL database you want your app to use." },
{ name: "WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL", type: "URL", isRequired: true, note: "Server uses this value as your client URL in various features e.g. linking to your app in e-mails." },
{ name: "WASP_SERVER_URL", type: "URL", isRequired: true, note: "Server uses this value as your server URL in various features e.g. to redirect users when logging in with OAuth providers like Google or GitHub." },
{ name: "JWT_SECRET", type: "String", isRequired: true, note: <>A random string of at least 32 characters. Needed to generate secure tokens.<br /><SecretGeneratorBlock /></> },
{ name: "PORT", type: "Integer", isRequired: false, defaultValue: "3001", note: "This is where the server listens for requests." }
]}
/>

##### SMTP Email Sender

If you are using `SMTP` as your email sender, you need to provide the following environment variables:

<EnvVarsTable
  envVars={[
{ name: "SMTP_HOST", type: "String", isRequired: true, note: "The SMTP server host." },
{ name: "SMTP_PORT", type: "Integer", isRequired: true, note: "The SMTP server port." },
{ name: "SMTP_USERNAME", type: "String", isRequired: true, note: "The SMTP server username." },
{ name: "SMTP_PASSWORD", type: "String", isRequired: true, note: "The SMTP server password." }
]}
/>

##### SendGrid Email Sender

If you are using `SendGrid` as your email sender, you need to provide the following environment variables:

<EnvVarsTable
  envVars={[
{ name: "SENDGRID_API_KEY", type: "String", isRequired: true, note: "The SendGrid API key." }
]}
/>

##### Mailgun Email Sender

If you are using `Mailgun` as your email sender, you need to provide the following environment variables:

<EnvVarsTable
  envVars={[
{ name: "MAILGUN_API_KEY", type: "String", isRequired: true, note: "The Mailgun API key." },
{ name: "MAILGUN_DOMAIN", type: "String", isRequired: true, note: "The Mailgun domain." },
{ name: "MAILGUN_API_URL", type: "URL", isRequired: false, note: <span>Useful if you want to use the EU API endpoint (<code>https://api.eu.mailgun.net</code>).</span> }
]}
/>

##### OAuth Providers

If you are using OAuth, you need to provide the following environment variables:

<EnvVarsTable
  envVars={[
{ name: "<PROVIDER_NAME>_CLIENT_ID", type: "String", isRequired: true, note: "The client ID provided by the OAuth provider." },
{ name: "<PROVIDER_NAME>_CLIENT_SECRET", type: "String", isRequired: true, note: "The client secret provided by the OAuth provider." }
]}
/>

<small>
  \* `<PROVIDER_NAME>` is the uppercase name of the provider you are using. For example, if you are using Google OAuth, you need to provide the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables.
</small>

If you are using [Keycloak](../auth/social-auth/keycloak.md), you'll need to provide one extra environment variable:

<EnvVarsTable
  envVars={[
{ name: "KEYCLOAK_REALM_URL", type: "URL", isRequired: true, note: "The URL of the Keycloak realm." }
]}
/>

##### Jobs

<EnvVarsTable
  envVars={[
{ name: "PG_BOSS_NEW_OPTIONS", type: "String", isRequired: false, note: <span>A <a href="#json-env-vars">JSON env var</a>. Enables you to provide <a href="../advanced/jobs#pg_boss_new_options">custom config</a> for PgBoss.</span> }
]}
/>

##### Development

We provide some helper env variables in development:

<EnvVarsTable
  envVars={[
{ name: "SKIP_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_IN_DEV", type: "Boolean", isRequired: false, defaultValue: "false", note: "If set to true, automatically sets user emails as verified in development." }
]}
/>

### Defining Env Vars in Development

During development (`wasp start`), there are two ways to provide env vars to your Wasp project:

1. Using `.env` files. **(recommended)**
2. Using shell. (useful for overrides)

#### 1. Using .env (dotenv) Files {#dotenv-files}

![Env vars usage in development](/img/env/prod_dev_fade.svg)

This is the recommended method for providing env vars to your Wasp project during development.

In the root of your Wasp project you can create two distinct files:

- `.env.server` for env vars that will be provided to the server.

Variables are defined in these files in the form of `NAME=VALUE`, for example:

```shell title=".env.server"
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432
SOME_VAR_NAME=somevalue
```

- `.env.client` for env vars that will be provided to the client.

  Variables are defined in these files in the form of `NAME=VALUE`, for example:

  ```shell title=".env.client"
  REACT_APP_SOME_VAR_NAME=somevalue
  ```

  <ClientEnvVarsNote />

`.env.server` should not be committed to version control as it can contain secrets, while `.env.client` can be versioned as it must not contain any secrets.
By default, in the `.gitignore` file that comes with a new Wasp app, we ignore all dotenv files.

#### 2. Using Shell

If you set environment variables in the shell where you run your Wasp commands (e.g., `wasp start`), Wasp will recognize them.

You can set environment variables in the `.profile` or a similar file, which will set them permanently, or you can set them temporarily by defining them at the start of a command (`SOME_VAR_NAME=SOMEVALUE wasp start`).

This is not specific to Wasp and is simply how environment variables can be set in the shell.

Defining environment variables in this way can be cumbersome even for a single project and even more challenging to manage if you have multiple Wasp projects. Therefore, we do not recommend this as a default method for providing environment variables to Wasp projects during development, you should use .env files instead. However, it can be useful for occasionally **overriding** specific environment variables because environment variables set this way **take precedence over those defined in `.env` files**.

### Defining Env Vars in Production

Defining env variables in production will depend on where you are deploying your Wasp project. In general, you will define them via mechanisms that your hosting provider provides.

We talk about how to define env vars for each deployment option in the [deployment section](../deployment/env-vars.md).

### JSON Env Vars {#json-env-vars}

Some of the environment variables you pass to Wasp are parsed as JSON values. This is useful for features needing more in-depth configuration, but it comes with the caveat of ensuring that the JSON syntax is valid.

The main issue comes in the form of escaping quotes, and the different ways to do it depending on where you are defining the env var.

##### In `.env` files

In `.env` files, you don't need to quote the full value, so you don't need to escape the quotes. For example, you can define a JSON object like this:

```shell title=".env.server"
PG_BOSS_NEW_OPTIONS={"connectionString":"...db url...","jobExpirationInSeconds":60,"maxRetries":3}
```

##### In the shell

In the shell, you need to quote the full value and escape the quotes inside the JSON object. For example, you can define a JSON object like this:

```shell
PG_BOSS_NEW_OPTIONS="{\"connectionString\":\"...db url...\",\"jobExpirationInSeconds\":60,\"maxRetries\":3}"
```

As an alternative, you can use single quotes to avoid escaping the quotes inside the JSON object:

```shell
PG_BOSS_NEW_OPTIONS='{"connectionString":"...db url...","jobExpirationInSeconds":60,"maxRetries":3}'
```

### Custom Env Var Validations

If your code requires some environment variables, you usually want to ensure that they are correctly defined. In Wasp, you can define your environment variables validation by defining a [Zod object schema](https://zod.dev/?id=basic-usage) and telling Wasp to use it.

:::info What is Zod?

[Zod](https://zod.dev/) is a library that lets you define what you expect from your data. For example, you can use Zod to define that:

- A value should be a string that's a valid email address.
- A value should be a number between 0 and 100.
- ... and much more.

:::

Take a look at an example of defining env vars validation:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/env.js"
    import * as z from 'zod'

    import { defineEnvValidationSchema } from 'wasp/env'

    export const serverEnvValidationSchema = defineEnvValidationSchema(
      z.object({
        STRIPE_API_KEY: z.string({
          required_error: 'STRIPE_API_KEY is required.',
        }),
      })
    )

    export const clientEnvValidationSchema = defineEnvValidationSchema(
      z.object({
        REACT_APP_NAME: z.string().default('TODO App'),
      })
    )
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/env.ts"
    import * as z from 'zod'

    import { defineEnvValidationSchema } from 'wasp/env'

    export const serverEnvValidationSchema = defineEnvValidationSchema(
      z.object({
        STRIPE_API_KEY: z.string({
          required_error: 'STRIPE_API_KEY is required.',
        }),
      })
    )

    export const clientEnvValidationSchema = defineEnvValidationSchema(
      z.object({
        REACT_APP_NAME: z.string().default('TODO App'),
      })
    )
    ```

    The `defineEnvValidationSchema` function ensures your Zod schema is type-checked.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  ...
  client: {
    envValidationSchema: import { clientEnvValidationSchema } from "@src/env",
  },
  server: {
    envValidationSchema: import { serverEnvValidationSchema } from "@src/env",
  },
}
```

You defined schemas for both the client and the server env vars and told Wasp to use them. Wasp merges your env validation schemas with the built-in env vars validation schemas when it validates the `process.env` object on the server and the `import.meta.env` object on the client.

This means you can use the `env` object to access **your env vars** like this:

```ts title="src/stripe.ts"

const stripeApiKey = env.STRIPE_API_KEY
```

Read more about the env object in the [API Reference](#api-reference).

### API Reference

There are **Wasp-defined** and **user-defined** env vars. Wasp already comes with built-in validation for Wasp-defined env vars. For your env vars, you can define your own validation.

#### Client Env Vars {#client-env-vars-api}

##### User-defined env vars validation

You can define your client env vars validation like this:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/env.js"
    import * as z from 'zod'

    import { defineEnvValidationSchema } from 'wasp/env'

    export const envValidationSchema = defineEnvValidationSchema(
      z.object({
        REACT_APP_ANALYTICS_ID: z.string({
          required_error: 'REACT_APP_ANALYTICS_ID is required.',
        }),
      })
    )
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/env.ts"
    import * as z from 'zod'

    import { defineEnvValidationSchema } from 'wasp/env'

    export const envValidationSchema = defineEnvValidationSchema(
      z.object({
        REACT_APP_ANALYTICS_ID: z.string({
          required_error: 'REACT_APP_ANALYTICS_ID is required.',
        }),
      })
    )
    ```

    The `defineEnvValidationSchema` function ensures your Zod schema is type-checked.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  ...
  client: {
    envValidationSchema: import { envValidationSchema } from "@src/env",
  },
}
```

Wasp merges your env validation schemas with the built-in env vars validation schemas when it validates the `import.meta.env` object.

##### Accessing env vars in client code

You can access both **Wasp-defined** and **user-defined** client env vars in your client code using the `env` object:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/App.js"
    import { env } from 'wasp/client'

    // Wasp-defined
    const apiUrl = env.REACT_APP_API_URL

    // User-defined
    const analyticsId = env.REACT_APP_ANALYTICS_ID
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/App.ts"
    import { env } from 'wasp/client'

    // Wasp-defined
    const apiUrl = env.REACT_APP_API_URL

    // User-defined
    const analyticsId = env.REACT_APP_ANALYTICS_ID
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can use `import.meta.env.REACT_APP_SOME_VAR_NAME` directly in your code. We don't recommend this since `import.meta.env` isn't validated and missing env vars can cause runtime errors.

#### Server Env Vars

##### User-defined env vars validation

You can define your env vars validation like this:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/env.js"
    import * as z from 'zod'

    import { defineEnvValidationSchema } from 'wasp/env'

    export const envValidationSchema = defineEnvValidationSchema(
      z.object({
        STRIPE_API_KEY: z.string({
          required_error: 'STRIPE_API_KEY is required.',
        }),
      })
    )
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/env.ts"
    import * as z from 'zod'

    import { defineEnvValidationSchema } from 'wasp/env'

    export const envValidationSchema = defineEnvValidationSchema(
      z.object({
        STRIPE_API_KEY: z.string({
          required_error: 'STRIPE_API_KEY is required.',
        }),
      })
    )
    ```

    The `defineEnvValidationSchema` function ensures your Zod schema is type-checked.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  ...
  server: {
    envValidationSchema: import { envValidationSchema } from "@src/env",
  },
}
```

Wasp merges your env validation schemas with the built-in env vars validation schemas when it validates the `process.env` object.

##### Accessing env vars in server code

You can access both **Wasp-defined** and **user-defined** client env vars in your client code using the `env` object:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/stripe.js"
    import { env } from 'wasp/server'

    // Wasp-defined
    const serverUrl = env.WASP_SERVER_URL

    // User-defined
    const stripeApiKey = env.STRIPE_API_KEY
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/stripe.ts"
    import { env } from 'wasp/server'

    // Wasp-defined
    const serverUrl = env.WASP_SERVER_URL

    // User-defined
    const stripeApiKey = env.STRIPE_API_KEY
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can use `process.env.SOME_SECRET` directly in your code. We don't recommend this since `process.env` isn't validated and missing env vars can cause runtime errors.

## Testing

:::info
Wasp is in beta, so keep in mind there might be some kinks / bugs, and possibly some changes with testing support in the future. If you encounter any issues, reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX) and we will make sure to help you out!
:::

### Testing Your React App

Wasp enables you to quickly and easily write both unit tests and React component tests for your frontend code. Because Wasp uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), we support testing web apps through [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

<details>
  <summary>Included Libraries</summary>

  <div>
    [`vitest`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitest): Unit test framework with native Vite support.

    [`@vitest/ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vitest/ui): A nice UI for seeing your test results.

    [`jsdom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom): A web browser test environment for Node.js.

    [`@testing-library/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/react) / [`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/jest-dom): Testing helpers.

    [`msw`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/msw): A server mocking library.
  </div>
</details>

#### Writing Tests

For Wasp to pick up your tests, they should be placed within the `src` directory and use an extension that matches [these glob patterns](https://vitest.dev/config#include). Some of the file names that Wasp will pick up as tests:

- `yourFile.test.ts`
- `YourComponent.spec.jsx`

Within test files, you can import your other source files as usual. For example, if you have a component `Counter.jsx`, you test it by creating a file in the same directory called `Counter.test.jsx` and import the component with `import Counter from './Counter'`.

#### Running Tests

Running `wasp test client` will start Vitest in watch mode and recompile your Wasp project when changes are made.

- If you want to see a real-time UI, pass `--ui` as an option.
- To run the tests just once, use `wasp test client run`.

All arguments after `wasp test client` are passed directly to the Vitest CLI, so check out [their documentation](https://vitest.dev/guide/cli.html) for all of the options.

:::warning Be Careful
You should not run `wasp test` while `wasp start` is running. Both will try to compile your project to `.wasp/out`.
:::

#### React Testing Helpers

Wasp provides several functions to help you write React tests:

- `renderInContext`: Takes a React component, wraps it inside a `QueryClientProvider` and `Router`, and renders it. This is the function you should use to render components in your React component tests.

  ```js
  import { renderInContext } from "wasp/client/test";

  renderInContext(<MainPage />);
  ```

- `mockServer`: Sets up the mock server and returns an object containing the `mockQuery` and `mockApi` utilities. This should be called outside of any test case, in each file that wants to use those helpers.

  ```js
  import { mockServer } from "wasp/client/test";

  const { mockQuery, mockApi } = mockServer();
  ```

  - `mockQuery`: Takes a Wasp [query](../data-model/operations/queries) to mock and the JSON data it should return.

    ```js
    import { getTasks } from "wasp/client/operations";

    mockQuery(getTasks, []);
    ```

    - Helpful when your component uses `useQuery`.
    - Behind the scenes, Wasp uses [`msw`](https://npmjs.com/package/msw) to create a server request handle that responds with the specified data.
    - Mock are cleared between each test.

  - `mockApi`: Similar to `mockQuery`, but for [APIs](../advanced/apis). Instead of a Wasp query, it takes a route containing an HTTP method and a path.

    ```js
    import { HttpMethod } from "wasp/client";

    mockApi({ method: HttpMethod.Get, path: "/foor/bar" }, { res: "hello" });
    ```

### Testing Your Server-Side Code

Wasp currently does not provide a way to test your server-side code, but we will be adding support soon. You can track the progress at [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/110) and express your interest by commenting.

### Examples

You can see some tests in a Wasp project [here](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/release/waspc/examples/todoApp/src/pages/auth/helpers.test.ts).

</Tabs>

## Dependencies

In a Wasp project, dependencies are defined in a standard way for JavaScript projects: using the [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/configuring-npm/package-json) file, located at the root of your project. You can list your dependencies under the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` fields.

#### Adding a New Dependency

To add a new package, like `date-fns` (a great date handling library), you use `npm`:

```bash
npm install date-fns
```

This command will add the package in the `dependencies` section of your `package.json` file.

You will notice that there are some other packages in the `dependencies` section, like `react` and `wasp`. These are the packages that Wasp uses internally, and you should not modify or remove them.

#### Using Packages that are Already Used by Wasp Internally

In the current version of Wasp, if Wasp is already internally using a certain dependency (e.g. React) with a certain version specified, you are not allowed to define that same npm dependency yourself while specifying _a different version_.

If you do that, you will get an error message telling you which exact version you have to use for that dependency.
This means Wasp _dictates exact versions of certain packages_, so for example you can't choose the version of React you want to use.

:::note

We are currently working on a restructuring that will solve this and some other quirks: check [issue #1644](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/1644) to follow our progress.

:::

## CSS Frameworks

### Tailwind

Wasp works great with [Tailwind CSS](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework. Currently, Wasp supports Tailwind CSS v3, but we are [working on supporting v4](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/2483) as well. You can use Tailwind CSS in your Wasp project by following the steps below.

#### Adding Tailwind to your Wasp project

1. Install Tailwind as a development dependency.

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss@3.2.7
```

2. Add `./tailwind.config.js`.

```js title="./tailwind.config.js"

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [resolveProjectPath('./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}')],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

:::note The `resolveProjectPath` function

Because Wasp copies the configuration files to the generated project, you must wrap any paths in the `content` array with the `resolveProjectPath` function. This function resolves the path to the generated project, so that Tailwind can find your source files.

:::

3. Add `./postcss.config.js`.

```js title="./postcss.config.js"
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

4. Import Tailwind into your CSS file. For example, in a new project you might import Tailwind into `Main.css`.

```css title="./src/Main.css" {1-3}
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* ... */
```

5. Start using Tailwind 🥳

```jsx title="./src/MainPage.jsx"
// ...

<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">
  Hello world!
</h1>

// ...
```

#### Adding Tailwind Plugins

To add Tailwind plugins, install them as npm development [dependencies](../project/dependencies) and add them to the plugins list in your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```shell
npm install -D @tailwindcss/forms
npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
```

and also
```js title="./tailwind.config.js" {5-6}
// ...

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    TailwindTypography,
    TailwindForms,
  ],
  // ...
}
```

## Custom Vite Config

Wasp uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to serve the client during development and bundling it for production. If you want to customize the Vite config, you can do that by editing the `vite.config.{js,ts}` file in your project root directory.

Wasp will use your config and **merge** it with the default Wasp's Vite config.

Vite config customization can be useful for things like:

- Adding custom Vite plugins.
- Customising the dev server.
- Customising the build process.

Be careful with making changes to the Vite config, as it can break the Wasp's client build process. Check out the default Vite config [here](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/release/waspc/data/Generator/templates/react-app/vite.config.ts) to see what you can change.

### Examples

Below are some examples of how you can customize the Vite config.

#### Changing the Dev Server Behaviour

If you want to stop Vite from opening the browser automatically when you run `wasp start`, you can do that by customizing the `open` option.

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="vite.config.js"
    export default {
      server: {
        open: false,
      },
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="vite.config.ts"
    import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

    export default defineConfig({
      server: {
        open: false,
      },
    })
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Custom Dev Server Port

You have access to all of the [Vite dev server options](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html) in your custom Vite config. You can change the dev server port by setting the `port` option.

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="vite.config.js"
    export default {
      server: {
        port: 4000,
      },
    }
    ```

    ```env title=".env.server"
    WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:4000
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="vite.config.ts"
    import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

    export default defineConfig({
      server: {
        port: 4000,
      },
    })
    ```

    ```env title=".env.server"
    WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:4000
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning Changing the dev server port
⚠️ Be careful when changing the dev server port, you'll need to update the `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL` env var in your `.env.server` file.
:::

#### Customising the Base Path

If you, for example, want to serve the client from a different path than `/`, you can do that by customizing the `base` option.

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="vite.config.js"
    export default {
      base: '/my-app/',
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="vite.config.ts"
    import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

    export default defineConfig({
      base: '/my-app/',
    })
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

# Deployment

## Introduction

After developing your app locally on your machine, the next step is to deploy it to the web so that others can access it.

In this section, we'll walk you through the steps to deploy your Wasp app.

#### Wasp app structure

Before we start, let's understand what Wasp generates when it builds your app.

What we call a "Wasp app" consists of three different parts:

- **Client app**
  - It's a single-page application (SPA), built using [React](https://react.dev/). It's what the user sees and interacts with.
  - It's usually served by some static file server or you can host it on a CDN like Cloudflare or Netlify.

- **Server app**:
  - The backend of your app, built using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) on Node.js.
  - It handles requests from the client app, interacts with the database, and returns responses.
  - It comes with a ready-to-use `Dockerfile` so you can easily package it and deploy it anywhere where Docker is supported.

- **Database**:
  - Wasp uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as its production database.
  - You can host the database on your own server or use a cloud service.

<ImgWithCaption source="/img/deploying/wasp-app-flow.gif" alt="Wasp app structure" caption="Data flow in a typical deployed Wasp app where all three parts are deployed separately" />

The thing to take away from this: the client app and server app are separate applications that communicate with each other over HTTP. This means you can deploy them on the same or different servers, depending on your needs.

We'll show you different ways of how deploy your app in the [deployment methods](./deployment-methods/overview.md) section.

Server needs to be able to communicate with the database, we'll show you how to set that up using [env variables](./env-vars.md).

#### Deploying your app

In the following sections, we'll go through all the different things you need to know about deployment:

- How [env variables](./env-vars.md) work in production - they are different than using .env files in development.
- Production [database setup](./database.md) - how migrations work, how to connect to the database, etc.
- Different deployment methods (using [Wasp's CLI](./deployment-methods/wasp-deploy/overview.md), [cloud services](./deployment-methods/paas.md), [self-hosting](./deployment-methods/self-hosted.md), etc.)
- How to [set up CI/CD](./ci-cd.md) for your app - automatically deploy your app when you push to your Git repository.
- Some [extras](./extras.md) like custom domains, CDN, etc.

## Env Variables

We talked about environment variables in the [project setup section](../project/env-vars.md). If you haven't read it, make sure to check it out first. In this section, we'll talk about environment variables in the context of deploying the app.

While developing our app on our machine, we had the option of using `.env.client` and `.env.server` files which made it easy to define and manage env vars.

However, when we are deploying our app, **`.env.client` and `.env.server` files will be ignored, and we need to provide env vars differently.**

![Env vars usage in development and production](/img/env/prod_dev_fade_2.svg)

#### Client Env Vars {#client-env-vars}

During the build process, client env vars are injected into the client Javascript code, making them public and readable by anyone. Therefore, you should **never store secrets in them** (such as secret API keys).

When building for production, the `.env.client` file will be ignored, since it is meant to be used only during development.
Instead, you should provide the production client env vars directly to the build command that turns client code into static files:

```shell
REACT_APP_API_URL=<url_to_wasp_backend> REACT_APP_SOME_OTHER_VAR_NAME=someothervalue npm run build
```

Also, notice **that you can't and shouldn't provide client env vars to the client code by setting them on the hosting provider** (unlike providing server env vars to the server app, in that case this is how you should do it). Your client code will ignore those, as at that point client code is just static files.

:::info How it works
What happens behind the scenes is that Wasp will replace all occurrences of `import.meta.env.REACT_APP_SOME_VAR_NAME` in your client code with the env var value you provided. This is done during the build process, so the value is injected into the static files produced from the client code.

Read more about it in Vite's [docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#production-replacement).
:::

#### Server Env Vars

When building your Wasp app for production `.env.server` will be ignored, since it is meant to be used only during development.

You can provide production env vars to your server code in production by defining them and making them available on the server where your server code is running.

::::caution Set the required env vars

Make sure to go through [all the required server env vars](../project/env-vars.md#server-general-configuration) like `DATABASE_URL`, `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL` etc. and set them up in your production environment.

**If you are using the [Wasp CLI](./deployment-methods/wasp-deploy/overview.md)** deployment method, Wasp will set the general configuration env vars for you, but you will need to set the rest of the env vars yourself (like the ones for OAuth auth methods or any other custom env vars you might have defined).
::::

Setting server env variables up will highly depend on where you are deploying your server, but in general it comes down to defining the env vars via mechanisms that your hosting provider provides.

For example, if you deploy your server to [Fly](https://fly.io), you can define them using the `fly` CLI tool:

```shell
fly secrets set SOME_VAR_NAME=somevalue
```

We talk about specific providers in the [PaaS deployment section](./deployment-methods/paas.md) or the [self-hosted deployment section](./deployment-methods/self-hosted.md).

## Database

In this section, we'll discuss what happens with the database when your app goes live. When you develop your app locally, you probably use a local dev database (started with `wasp start db` or some other way). However, when it's time to deploy your app, you'll need to set up a production database.

#### Production database requirements

The server app that Wasp generates uses a PostgreSQL database. The only requirement from Wasp's point of view is that the database is accessible from the server via the `DATABASE_URL` server env variable.

It can be a PostgreSQL database running on the same server as the server app, or it can be a managed PostgreSQL database service like [Fly Postgres](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/), [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), or some other service.

### Migrations

Every time you make a change in your [Prisma schema](../data-model/prisma-file.md) e.g. adding a new model, changing a field type, etc., you need to create a migration. Migrations are some code that describes the change you made in the schema, and they are used to apply the change to the database.

The benefit of migrations is that you can apply the same change to multiple databases. If there are multiple people working on the project, they can all apply the same changes to their local databases. When you deploy the app to production, the same chaanges are applied to the production database.

#### Creating migrations

After you made a change in the Prisma schema, you can create a migration by running the following command:

```bash
wasp db migrate-dev
```

This command will create a new migration in the `migrations` directory. The migration is a set of SQL commands that describe the change you made in the schema.

#### Applying migrations

**In development**, the migrations are applied as soon as you run the `wasp start` command.

**In production**, the server app first checks if there are any new migrations that need to be applied, and if there are, it applies them before starting the server. This way, the database schema is always in sync with the Prisma schema.

:::note How it works

In the built server app, there are two npm scripts: `start` and `start-production`. The `start` script is used in development, and the `start-production` script is used in production. The `start-production` script first applies any pending migrations before starting the server.

:::

The migrations might fail to apply if there is a conflict with the existing data in the database. In that case, you'll need to fix the migration and try again.

#### Debugging failed migrations

If a migration fails to apply, the server app will log the error message and stop. You should then connect to the production database and see what went wrong. If you check the `_prisma_migrations` table, you'll see the failed migration there.

You can try resolving the erorr e.g. if you tried adding a `@unique` constraint to a field that already has duplicate values:

1. Remove any duplicate values from the database
2. Remove the failed migration from the `_prisma_migrations` table
3. Try applying the migration again by restarting the server app

:::tip Viewing the `_prisma_migrations` table

You can't use the `wasp db studio` command to view the `_prisma_migrations` table in the production database, but you can use a database management tool like [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) or [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/).
:::

### Connect to the production database

**In development**, you can use the `wasp db studio` command to open a web-based database management tool that allows you to inspect the database.

You can use the same tool to inspect the **production database**, but you'll need to set the `DATABASE_URL` env variable to point to the production database. Set the `DATABASE_URL` env variable in your terminal before running the `wasp db studio` command:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname" wasp db studio
```

:::caution Be careful with the `DATABASE_URL` env variable

Setting the `DATABASE_URL` env variable in the `.env.server` file to point to your production database also works, but then you might forget to remove it and you could accidentally make changes to the production database when you run `wasp start` in development.

That's why we recommend setting the `DATABASE_URL` env variable in the terminal to avoid this.

:::

If you are looking how to connect to a Fly.io production database, we wrote a [guide](https://github.com/wasp-lang/learning-materials/?tab=readme-ov-file#running-wasp-db-studio-on-production-db) on how to do that.

## Testing the build locally

`wasp build start` lets you test your production build locally before deployment, ensuring everything works correctly before going live.

This command takes the output of `wasp build` and starts a local server to run it. That means that you can test using the same optimized code that would be deployed to production. You also configure it with the same environment variables you'd use in production, which helps you catch configuration issues before deploying.

While it's not identical to a real production environment, it's the closest you can get to testing your deployed app without actually deploying it.

:::warning This is not a deployment command
`wasp build start` is only intended for testing your `wasp build` output locally, and is not designed for serving your app in production. For that, check out our [deployment guide](./intro.md).
:::

### Usage

```bash
## Start a local database, copy the connection URL
wasp start db

## Start the local production build server
## (this is an example, you'll probably need to add more environment variables)
wasp build start --server-env DATABASE_URL=<your-database-url> --server-env JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
```

:::tip
For `JWT_SECRET`, you can generate a random secret here: <SecretGeneratorBlock />.

You might need to pass other environment variables as well, depending on your app's configuration. Check our [Environment variables reference](../project/env-vars.md) for more details.
:::

This command will:

- Start a local server serving your production build (the output of `wasp build`).
- Use only the environment variables you set explicitly.
- Use the same bundled assets that would be deployed.
- Run in production mode with optimizations enabled.

### Why?

The main reason for using `wasp build start` is to catch dependencies on your local development environment that might not work in production.

For example, your app might rely on environment variables that are set in your local `.env` files. `wasp start` by default will read these files and use them. While this makes it easy to develop your app locally, it also makes it easy to lose track of which environment variables your app actually needs in production.

`wasp build start` forces you to explicitly specify the environment variables your app needs to run in production. This helps you double-check which ones you also need to set in your deployment environment for the app to work correctly.

Your code might also depend on some development-only features in your libraries, such as React development or strict mode. `wasp build start` runs your app as they would for your users, which means that these features are disabled. This helps you catch issues that might only appear in production.

You should treat this command as the last check before deploying your app, confirming that you know all required environment variables and that integrations behave as expected with production settings on. It is also the best way to reproduce issues that only appear in production, which can be very useful for debugging.

### Differences from `wasp start`

### Passing environment variables

You must manually specify any environment variables that your app needs to run in production. This is crucial because the production build may require different configurations from the development build. This helps you take note of which ones you also need to set in your deployment environment for the app to work correctly.

Environment variables include database URLs, API keys, and any other configuration settings necessary for your app to function correctly. You can usually check out your [`.env` files](../project/env-vars.md#dotenv-files) to see what environment variables your app expects. You can read more about environment variables in Wasp in the [environment variables guide](../project/env-vars.md).

The only exception is the environment variables that configure your app's client and server URLs (`WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL`, `WASP_SERVER_URL`, and `REACT_APP_API_URL`). Because `wasp build start` knows that it's running the app on your local workstation, it can fill them out for you automatically.

#### Which values should I use when testing?

- Do not use real production secrets or endpoints.
- Prefer staging/sandbox credentials and services that mirror production (e.g., Stripe test keys, a staging DB, or an isolated local DB with realistic data).
- Keep config parity with production: same feature flags, callbacks/redirect URLs, and optional vars set/unset as in prod.

Example:

```bash
wasp build start --server-env-file .env.staging --client-env-file .env.client.staging
```

#### Server environment variables

Use `--server-env` to specify environment variables for the server:

```bash
wasp build start --server-env DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/myapp
```

You can specify multiple server environment variables:

```bash
wasp build start --server-env DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/myapp --server-env JWT_SECRET=my-secret-key
```

You can also point to an `.env` file to load environment variables:

```bash
wasp build start --server-env-file .env.production
```

:::warning
Do not commit your `.env` files with sensitive information to your version control system. Use `.gitignore` to exclude them.
:::

#### Client environment variables

Use `--client-env` to specify environment variables for the client:

```bash
wasp build start --client-env REACT_APP_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=GA-123456
```

Multiple client environment variables:

```bash
wasp build start --client-env REACT_APP_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=GA-123456 --client-env REACT_APP_PLAUSIBLE_ID=PLAUSIBLE-123456
```

You can also point to an `.env` file for client variables:

```bash
wasp build start --client-env-file .env.client.production
```

:::warning
Do not commit your `.env` files with sensitive information to your version control system. Use `.gitignore` to exclude them.
:::

## Deployment Overview

Wasp apps are full-stack apps that consist of:

- A Node.js server.
- A static client.
- A PostgreSQL database.

You can deploy each part **anywhere** where you can usually deploy Node.js apps or static apps. For example, you can deploy your client on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), the server on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/), and the database on [Neon](https://neon.tech/).

To make deploying as smooth as possible, Wasp also offers a single-command deployment called **Wasp Deploy**.

<DeploymentOptionsGrid />

Regardless of how you choose to deploy your app (i.e., manually or using the Wasp CLI), you'll need to know about some common patterns covered below.

### Customizing the Dockerfile

By default, Wasp generates a multi-stage Dockerfile.
This file is used to build and run a Docker image with the Wasp-generated server code.
It also runs any pending migrations.

You can **add extra steps to this multi-stage `Dockerfile`** by creating your own `Dockerfile` in the project's root directory.
If Wasp finds a Dockerfile in the project's root, it appends its contents at the _bottom_ of the default multi-stage Dockerfile.

Since the last definition in a Dockerfile wins, you can override or continue from any existing build stages.
You can also choose not to use any of our build stages and have your own custom Dockerfile used as-is.

A few things to keep in mind:

- If you override an intermediate build stage, no later build stages will be used unless you reproduce them below.
- The generated Dockerfile's content is dynamic and depends on which features your app uses. The content can also change in future releases, so please verify it from time to time.
- Make sure to supply `ENTRYPOINT` in your final build stage. Your changes won't have any effect if you don't.

Read more in the official Docker docs on [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/).

To see what your project's (potentially combined) Dockerfile will look like, run:

```shell
wasp dockerfile
```

## Overview of Automated Deployment with Wasp CLI

Wasp CLI can deploy your full-stack application with a single command.
The command automates the manual deployment process and is the recommended way of deploying Wasp apps.

It looks like this:
```shell
wasp deploy <provider> launch my-wasp-app
```

The `wasp deploy` command sets up all the necessary services on the provider, builds your Wasp app, and deploys it.

#### Supported Providers

Wasp Deploy supports automated deployment to the following providers:

<WaspDeployProvidersGrid />

## Automated Deployment to Fly.io with Wasp CLI

[Fly.io](https://fly.io/) is a platform for running containerized apps and microservices on servers around the world. It makes deploying and managing your apps straightforward with minimal setup.

### Prerequisites

To deploy to Fly.io using Wasp CLI:

1. Create a [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) account

1. Fly requires you to add a payment method before you can deploy more than two Fly apps. To deploy Wasp apps, you need three Fly apps: the client, the server, and the database.

2. Install the [`fly` CLI](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/) on your machine.

### Deploying

Using the Wasp CLI, you can easily deploy a new app to [Fly.io](https://fly.io) with just a single command:

```shell
wasp deploy fly launch my-wasp-app mia
```

<small>
  Please do not CTRL-C or exit your terminal while the commands are running.
</small>

Two things to keep in mind:

1. Your app name (for example `my-wasp-app`) must be **unique** across all of Fly or deployment will fail.

1. If your account is a member of **more than one organization** on Fly.io, you will need to specify under which one you want to execute the command. To do that, provide an additional `--org <org-slug>` option. You can find out the names (slugs) of your organizations by running `fly orgs list`.

The `launch` command uses the app basename `my-wasp-app` and deploy it to the `mia` region (`mia` is short for _Miami, Florida (US)_). Read more about Fly.io regions [here](#flyio-regions).

The basename is used to create all three app tiers, resulting in three separate apps in your Fly dashboard:

- `my-wasp-app-client`
- `my-wasp-app-server`
- `my-wasp-app-db`

You'll notice that Wasp creates two new files in your project root directory:

- `fly-server.toml`
- `fly-client.toml`

You should include these files in your version control so that you can deploy your app with a single command in the future.

<LaunchCommandEnvVars />

If your app requires any additional environment variables, use the `wasp deploy fly cmd secrets set` command. Read more in the [API Reference](#flyio-cli-environment-variables) section.

### Using a Custom Domain For Your App {#custom-domain}

Setting up a custom domain is a three-step process:

1. You need to add your domain to your Fly client app. You can do this by running:

```shell
wasp deploy fly cmd --context client certs create mycoolapp.com
```

:::note Use Your Domain
Make sure to replace `mycoolapp.com` with your domain in all of the commands mentioned in this section.
:::

This command will output the instructions to add the DNS records to your domain. It will look something like this:

```shell-session
You can direct traffic to mycoolapp.com by:

1: Adding an A record to your DNS service which reads

    A @ 66.241.1XX.154

You can validate your ownership of mycoolapp.com by:

2: Adding an AAAA record to your DNS service which reads:

    AAAA @ 2a09:82XX:1::1:ff40
```

2. You need to add the DNS records for your domain:

   _This will depend on your domain provider, but it should be a matter of adding an A record for `@` and an AAAA record for `@` with the values provided by the previous command._

3. You need to set your domain as the `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL` environment variable for your server app:

```shell
wasp deploy fly cmd --context server secrets set WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL=https://mycoolapp.com
```

<small>
  We need to do this to keep our CORS configuration up to date.
</small>

That's it, your app should be available at `https://mycoolapp.com`!

#### Adding a `www` Subdomain

If you'd also like to access your app at `https://www.mycoolapp.com`, you can generate certificates for the `www` subdomain.

```shell
wasp deploy fly cmd --context client certs create www.mycoolapp.com
```

Once you do that, you will need to add another DNS record for your domain. It should be a CNAME record for `www` with the value of your root domain.
Here's an example:

| Type  | Name | Value         | TTL  |
| ----- | ---- | ------------- | ---- |
| CNAME | www  | mycoolapp.com | 3600 |

With the CNAME record (Canonical name), you are assigning the `www` subdomain as an alias to the root domain.

Your app should now be available both at the root domain `https://mycoolapp.com` and the `www` sub-domain `https://www.mycoolapp.com`.

:::caution CORS Configuration

Using the `www` and `non-www` domains at the same time will require you to update your CORS configuration to allow both domains. You'll need to provide [custom CORS configuration](https://gist.github.com/infomiho/5ca98e5e2161df4ea78f76fc858d3ca2) in your server app to allow requests from both domains.

:::

### API Reference

#### `launch` command

`launch` is a convenience command that runs `setup`, `create-db`, and `deploy` in sequence.

```shell
wasp deploy fly launch <app-name> <region>
```

It accepts the following arguments:

- `<app-name>` Required!

  The name of your app.

- `<region>`  Required!

  The region where your app will be deployed. Read how to find the available regions [here](#flyio-regions).

Running `wasp deploy fly launch` is the same as running the following commands:

```shell
wasp deploy fly setup <app-name> <region>
wasp deploy fly create-db <region>
wasp deploy fly deploy
```

##### Environment Variables {#fly-launch-environment-variables}

###### Server

If you are deploying an app that requires any other environment variables (like social auth secrets), you can set them with the `--server-secret` option:

```
wasp deploy fly launch my-wasp-app mia --server-secret GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<...> --server-secret GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<...>
```

###### Client

If you've added any [client-side environment variables](../../../project/env-vars.md#client-env-vars) to your app, pass them to the terminal session before running the `launch` command, for example:

```shell
REACT_APP_ANOTHER_VAR=somevalue wasp deploy fly launch my-wasp-app mia
```

##### The `setup` command

The `setup` command registers your client and server apps on Fly, and sets up needed environment variables.
It only needs to be run once, when initially creating the app. It does _not_ trigger a deploy for the client or server apps.

```shell
wasp deploy fly setup <app-name> <region>
```

It accepts the following arguments:

- `<app-name>` Required!

  The name of your app.

- `<region>` Required!

  The region where your app will be deployed. Read how to find the available regions [here](#flyio-regions).

After running `setup`, Wasp creates two new files in your project root directory: `fly-server.toml` and `fly-client.toml`.
You should include these files in your version control.

You **can edit the `fly-server.toml` and `fly-client.toml` files** to further configure your Fly deployments. Wasp will use the TOML files when you run `deploy`.

If you want to maintain multiple apps, you can add the `--fly-toml-dir <abs-path>` option to point to different directories, like "dev" or "staging".

:::caution Execute Only Once
You should only run `setup` once per app. If you run it multiple times, it creates unnecessary apps on Fly.
:::

##### The `create-db` command

The `create-db` command creates a new database for your app.

```shell
wasp deploy fly create-db <region>
```

It accepts the following arguments:

- `<region>` Required!

  The region where your app will be deployed. Read how to find the available regions [here](#flyio-regions).

:::caution Execute Only Once
You should only run `create-db` once per app. If you run it multiple times, it creates multiple databases, but your app needs only one.
:::

##### The `deploy` command

```shell
wasp deploy fly deploy
```

The `deploy` command pushes your built client and server live.

Run this command whenever you want to **update your deployed app** with the latest changes:

```shell
wasp deploy fly deploy
```

If you've added any [client-side environment variables](../../../project/env-vars#client-env-vars) to your app, pass them to the terminal session before running the `deploy` command, for example:

```shell
REACT_APP_ANOTHER_VAR=somevalue wasp deploy fly deploy
```

You must specify your client-side environment variables every time you redeploy with the above command [to ensure they are included in the build process](../../env-vars.md#client-env-vars).

##### The `cmd` command

If you want to run arbitrary Fly commands (for example `fly secrets list` for your server app), here's how to do it:

```shell
wasp deploy fly cmd secrets list --context server
```

#### Environment Variables {#flyio-cli-environment-variables}

##### Server Secrets

If your app requires any other server-side environment variables (like social auth secrets), you can set them:

1. Initially, in the `launch` or `setup` commands with the [`--server-secret` option](#fly-launch-environment-variables)
2. After the app has already been deployed by using the `secrets set` command:

    ```
    wasp deploy fly cmd secrets set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<...> GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<...> --context=server
    ```

##### Client Environment Variables

If you've added any [client-side environment variables](../../../project/env-vars.md#client-env-vars) to your app, pass them to the terminal session before running a deployment command, for example:

```shell
REACT_APP_ANOTHER_VAR=somevalue wasp deploy fly launch my-wasp-app mia
```

or

```shell
REACT_APP_ANOTHER_VAR=somevalue wasp deploy fly deploy
```

Please note that you should do this for **every deployment**, not just the first time you set up the variables. One way to make sure you don't forget to add them is to create a `deploy` script in your `package.json` file:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "REACT_APP_ANOTHER_VAR=somevalue wasp deploy fly deploy"
  }
}
```

Then you can run `npm run deploy` to deploy your app.

#### Fly.io Regions

> Fly.io runs applications physically close to users: in datacenters around the world, on servers we run ourselves. You can currently deploy your apps in 34 regions, connected to a global Anycast network that makes sure your users hit our nearest server, whether they’re in Tokyo, São Paolo, or Frankfurt.

<small>
  Read more on Fly regions [here](https://fly.io/docs/reference/regions/).
</small>

You can find the list of all available Fly regions by running:

```shell
fly platform regions
```

#### Multiple Fly.io Organizations

If you have multiple organizations, you can specify a `--org` option. For example:

```shell
wasp deploy fly launch my-wasp-app mia --org hive
```

#### Building Locally

Fly.io offers support for both **locally** built Docker containers and **remotely** built ones. However, for simplicity and reproducibility, the CLI defaults to the use of a remote Fly.io builder.

If you want to build locally, supply the `--build-locally` option to `wasp deploy fly launch` or `wasp deploy fly deploy`.

## Automated Deployment to Railway with Wasp CLI

[Railway](https://railway.com/?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=wasp) is a cloud development platform that streamlines building and deploying applications with built-in support for databases and services. It offers an intuitive interface and automates infrastructure.

### Prerequisites

To deploy to Railway using Wasp CLI:

1. Create a [Railway](https://railway.com/?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=wasp) account,

1. Install the [`railway` CLI](https://docs.railway.com/guides/cli?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=wasp#installing-the-cli) on your machine.

### Deploying

Using the Wasp CLI, you can easily deploy a new app to Railway with a single command:

```shell
wasp deploy railway launch my-wasp-app
```

<small>
  Please do not CTRL-C or exit your terminal while the commands are running.
</small>

Keep in mind that:

1. Your project name (for example `my-wasp-app`) must be unique across all your Railway projects or deployment will fail (this is a current limitation of the Wasp CLI and Railway integration [#2926](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/2926)).

1. If you are a member of multiple Railway organizations, the CLI will prompt you to select the organization under which you want to deploy your app.

The project name is used as a base for your server and client service names on Railway:

- `my-wasp-app-client`
- `my-wasp-app-server`

Railway doesn't allow setting the database service name using the Railway CLI. It will always be named `Postgres`.

<LaunchCommandEnvVars />

If you have any additional environment variables that your app needs, read how to set them in the [API Reference](#railway-environment-variables) section.

### Using a Custom Domain For Your App {#custom-domain}

Setting up a custom domain is a three-step process:

1. Add your domain to the Railway client service:

    - Go into the [Railway dashboard](https://railway.com/dashboard?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=wasp).
    - Select your project (for example `my-wasp-app`).
    - Click on the client service (for example `my-wasp-app-client`).
    - Go to the **Settings** tab and click **Custom Domain**.
    - Enter your domain name (for example `mycoolapp.com`) and port `8080`.
    - Click **Add Domain**.

2. Update the DNS records for your domain, adding a CNAME record at the domain or subdomain you want, pointing to the address you've been given in the previous step. _This step depends on your domain provider, consult their documentation in case of doubt._

3. To avoid [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) errors, you need to set your new client URL as the `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL` environment variable (for example `https://mycoolapp.com`) for your **server service** in the Railway dashboard.

    - Go into the [Railway dashboard](https://railway.com/dashboard?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=wasp).
    - Select your project (for example `my-wasp-app`).
    - Click on the server service (for example `my-wasp-app-server`).
    - Go to the **Variables** tab.

    Update the `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL` variable with the new domain for your client.

That's it, your app should be available at `https://mycoolapp.com`!

### API Reference

#### The `launch` command

`launch` is a convenience command that runs `setup` and `deploy` in sequence.

```shell
wasp deploy railway launch <project-name>
```

It accepts the following arguments:

- `<project-name>` Required!

  The name of your project.

Running `wasp deploy railway launch` is the same as running the following commands:

```shell
wasp deploy railway setup <project-name>
wasp deploy railway deploy <project-name>
```

##### Explicitly providing the Railway project ID

By default, Wasp CLI tries to create a new Railway project named `<project-name>`. If you want to use an existing Railway project, pass its ID with `--existing-project-id` option:

```shell
wasp deploy railway launch <project-name> --existing-project-id <railway-project-id>
```

##### Explicitly providing the Railway Workspace

By default, Wasp CLI will prompt you to select a Railway workspace for your project. If you want to skip the prompt and provide the workspace id or name directly, use the `--workspace` option:

```shell
wasp deploy railway launch <project-name> --workspace <railway-workspace-id-or-name>
```

##### Environment Variables {#railway-launch-environment-variables}

###### Server

If you are deploying an app that requires any other environment variables (like social auth secrets), you can set them with the `--server-secret` option:

```
wasp deploy railway launch my-wasp-app --server-secret GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<...> --server-secret GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<...>
```

###### Client

If you've added any [client-side environment variables](../../../project/env-vars.md#client-env-vars) to your app, pass them to the terminal session before running the `launch` command, for example:

```shell
REACT_APP_ANOTHER_VAR=somevalue wasp deploy railway launch my-wasp-app
```

#### The `deploy` command

The `deploy` command deploys your client and server apps to Railway.

```shell
wasp deploy railway deploy <project-name>
```

It accepts the following arguments:

- `<project-name>` Required!

  The name of your project.

Run this command whenever you want to **update your deployed app** with the latest changes:

```shell
wasp deploy railway deploy <project-name>
```

##### Explicitly providing the Railway project ID

When you run the `deploy` command, Wasp CLI will use the Railway project that's linked to the Wasp project directory. If no Railway project is linked, the command will fail asking you to run the `setup` command first.

If you are deploying your Railway app in the CI, you can pass the `--existing-project-id` option to tell Wasp CLI the Railway project ID to use for the deployment:

```shell
wasp deploy railway deploy <project-name> --existing-project-id <railway-project-id>
```

##### Other Available Options

- `--skip-client` - do not deploy the web client
- `--skip-server` - do not deploy the server

If you've added any [client-side environment variables](../../../project/env-vars.md#client-env-vars) to your app, pass them to the terminal session before running the `deploy` command, for example:

```shell
REACT_APP_ANOTHER_VAR=somevalue wasp deploy railway deploy <project-name>
```

You must specify your client-side environment variables every time you redeploy with the above command [to ensure they are included in the build process](../../env-vars.md#client-env-vars).

#### The `setup` command

The `setup` command creates your client, server, and database services on Railway. It also configures environment variables. It does _not_ deploy the client or server services.

```shell
wasp deploy railway setup <project-name>
```

It accepts the following arguments:

- `<project-name>`

  the name of your project.

The project name is used as a base for your server and client service names on Railway:

- `<project-name>-client`
- `<project-name>-server`

Railway also creates a PostgreSQL database service named `Postgres`.

##### Explicitly providing the Railway project ID

By default, Wasp CLI tries to create a new Railway project named `<project-name>`. If you want to use an existing Railway project, pass its ID with `--existing-project-id` option:

```shell
wasp deploy railway setup <project-name> --existing-project-id <railway-project-id>
```

##### Explicitly providing the Railway Workspace

By default, Wasp CLI will prompt you to select in which Railway workspace you want to create your project. If you want to skip the prompt and provide the workspace id or name directly, use the `--workspace` option:

```shell
wasp deploy railway setup <project-name> --workspace <railway-workspace-id-or-name>
```

:::caution Execute Only Once
You should only run `setup` once per app. Wasp CLI skips creating the services if they already exist.
:::

#### Environment Variables {#railway-environment-variables}

##### Server Secrets

If your app requires any other server-side environment variables (like social auth secrets), you can set them:

1. Initially in the `launch` or `setup` commands with the [`--server-secret` option](#railway-launch-environment-variables)
2. After the app has already been deployed, go into the Railway dashboard and set them in the **Variables** tab of your server service.

##### Client Environment Variables

If you've added any [client-side environment variables](../../../project/env-vars.md#client-env-vars) to your app, pass them to the terminal session before running a deployment command, for example:

```shell
REACT_APP_ANOTHER_VAR=somevalue wasp deploy railway launch my-wasp-app
```

or

```shell
REACT_APP_ANOTHER_VAR=somevalue wasp deploy railway deploy
```

Please note that you should do this for **every deployment**, not just the first time you set up the variables. One way to make sure you don't forget to add them is to create a `deploy` script in your `package.json` file:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "REACT_APP_ANOTHER_VAR=somevalue wasp deploy railway deploy"
  }
}
```

Then you can run `npm run deploy` to deploy your app.

## Cloud Providers

You can deploy the built Wasp app wherever and however you want, as long as your provider/server supports Wasp's build format.

After going through the general steps that apply to all deployments, you can
follow step-by-step guides for deploying your Wasp app to some of the most popular
providers:

- [Fly.io](#flyio)
- [Railway](#railway)
- [Heroku](#heroku)
- [Netlify](#netlify)
- [Cloudflare](#cloudflare)

No worries, you can still deploy your app if your desired provider isn't on the
list - it just means we don't yet have a step-by-step guide for you to follow.
Feel free to [open a
PR](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/release/web/docs/deployment/deployment-methods/paas.md)
if you'd like to write one yourself :)

### Deploying a Wasp App

Deploying a Wasp app comes down to the following:

1. Generating deployable code.
2. Deploying the API server (backend).
3. Deploying the web client (frontend).
4. Deploying a PostgreSQL database and keeping it running.

Let's go through each of these steps.

#### 1. Generating Deployable Code

Running the command `wasp build` generates deployable code for the whole app in the `.wasp/build/` directory.

```
wasp build
```

:::caution PostgreSQL in production
You won't be able to build the app if you are using SQLite as a database (which is the default database).
You'll have to [switch to PostgreSQL](../../data-model/databases.md#migrating-from-sqlite-to-postgresql) before deploying to production.
:::

#### 2. Deploying the API Server <Server />

There's a Dockerfile that defines an image for building the server in the `.wasp/build` directory.

To run the server in production, deploy this Docker image to a hosting provider and make sure the required env variables are correctly set up. Usually, you use the provider's dashboard UI or a CLI tool to set up these env variables.

Check the [required server env variables](../env-vars.md#server-env-vars) and make sure they are set up for your server.

While these are the general instructions on deploying the server anywhere, we also have more detailed instructions for chosen providers below, so check that out for more guidance if you are deploying to one of those providers.

#### 3. Deploying the Web Client <Client />

<BuildingTheWebClient />

The command above will build the web client and put it in the `build/` directory in the `.wasp/build/web-app/`.

Since the result of building is just a bunch of static files, you can now deploy your web client to any static hosting provider (e.g. Netlify, Cloudflare, ...) by deploying the contents of `.wasp/build/web-app/build/`.

#### 4. Deploying the Database <Database />

Any PostgreSQL database will do, as long as you provide the server with the correct `DATABASE_URL` env var and ensure that the database is accessible from the server.

### Different Providers

We'll cover a few different deployment providers below:

- Fly.io <Server /> <Database />
- Railway <Server /> <Client /> <Database />
- Heroku <Server /> <Database />
- Netlify <Client />
- Cloudflare <Client />

### Fly.io <Server /> <Database /> {#flyio}

In this section, we'll show how to deploy your server and provision a database for it on Fly.io.

:::info One command deploy

We recommend that you use [Wasp Deploy](./wasp-deploy/fly.md) to deploy your Wasp app to Fly.io. Wasp CLI automates deploying the client, the server and the database with one command.

:::

#### Prerequisites

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Create a [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) account,
1. Install the [`fly` CLI](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/),
1. Log in with the `fly` CLI.

You can check if you are logged in with `fly auth whoami`, and if you are not, you can log in with `fly auth login`.

#### Set Up a Fly.io App

:::info
You need to do this only once per Wasp app.
:::

Unless you already have a Fly.io app that you want to deploy to, let's create a new Fly.io app.

After you have [built the app](#1-generating-deployable-code), position yourself in `.wasp/build/` directory:

```shell
cd .wasp/build
```

Next, run the launch command to set up a new app and create a `fly.toml` file:

```bash
fly launch --remote-only
```

This will ask you a series of questions, such as asking you to choose a region and whether you'd like a database.

- Say **yes** to **Would you like to set up a PostgreSQL database now?** and select **Development**. Fly.io will set a `DATABASE_URL` for you.
- Say **no** to **Would you like to deploy now?** (and to any additional questions).

  We still need to set up several environment variables.

:::info What if the database setup fails?
If your attempts to initiate a new app fail for whatever reason, then you should run `fly apps destroy <app-name>` before trying again. Fly does not allow you to create multiple apps with the same name.

<details>
  <summary>
    What does it look like when your DB is deployed correctly?
  </summary>

  <div>
    <p>When your DB is deployed correctly, you'll see it in the <a href="https://fly.io/dashboard">Fly.io dashboard</a>:</p>

    <img width="662" alt="image" src="/img/deploying/fly-db.png" />
  </div>
</details>

:::

Next, let's copy the `fly.toml` file up to our Wasp project dir for safekeeping.

```shell
cp fly.toml ../../
```

Next, add a few more environment variables for the server code.

```bash
fly secrets set PORT=8080
fly secrets set JWT_SECRET=<random_string_at_least_32_characters_long>
fly secrets set WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL=<url_of_where_client_will_be_deployed>
fly secrets set WASP_SERVER_URL=<url_of_where_server_will_be_deployed>
```

We can help you generate a `JWT_SECRET`:<br/><SecretGeneratorBlock />

:::note
If you do not know what your client URL is yet, don't worry. You can set `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL` after you deploy your client.
:::

<AddExternalAuthEnvVarsReminder />

If you want to make sure you've added your secrets correctly, run `fly secrets list` in the terminal. Note that you will see hashed versions of your secrets to protect your sensitive data.

#### Deploy to a Fly.io App

While still in the `.wasp/build/` directory, run:

```bash
fly deploy --remote-only --config ../../fly.toml
```

This will build and deploy the backend of your Wasp app on Fly.io to `https://<app-name>.fly.dev` 🤘🎸

Now, if you haven't, you can deploy your client and add the client URL by running `fly secrets set WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL=<url_of_deployed_client>`. We suggest using [Netlify](#netlify) for your client, but you can use any static hosting provider.

Additionally, some useful `fly` commands:

```bash
fly logs
fly secrets list
fly ssh console
```

#### Redeploying After Wasp Builds

When you rebuild your Wasp app (with `wasp build`), it will remove your `.wasp/build/` directory. In there, you may have a `fly.toml` from any prior Fly.io deployments.

While we will improve this process in the future, in the meantime, you have a few options:

1. Copy the `fly.toml` file to a versioned directory, like your Wasp project dir.

From there, you can reference it in `fly deploy --config <path>` commands, like above.

1. Backup the `fly.toml` file somewhere before running `wasp build`, and copy it into .wasp/build/ after.

When the `fly.toml` file exists in .wasp/build/ dir, you do not need to specify the `--config <path>`.

1. Run `fly config save -a <app-name>` to regenerate the `fly.toml` file from the remote state stored in Fly.io.

### Railway <Server /> <Client /> <Database /> {#railway}

In this section, we'll show how to deploy the client, the server, and provision a database on Railway.

:::info One command deploy

We recommend that you use [Wasp Deploy](./wasp-deploy/railway.md) to deploy your Wasp app to Railway. Wasp CLI automates deploying the client, the server and the database with one command.

:::

#### Prerequisites

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Make sure your Wasp app is built by running `wasp build` in the project dir.
1. Create a [Railway](https://railway.com/?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=wasp) account.
1. Install the [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.com/develop/cli?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=wasp#installing-the-cli).
1. Run `railway login` and a browser tab will open to authenticate you.

#### Create New Project

Let's create our Railway project:

1. Go to your [Railway dashboard](https://railway.com/dashboard?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=wasp), click on **New Project**, and select **Deploy PostgreSQL** from the dropdown menu.
1. Once the project is created, left-click on the **Create** button in the top right corner and select **Empty Service**.
1. Click on the new service, and change the name to `server`.
1. Create another empty service and name it `client`.
1. Deploy the changes by pressing the **Deploy** button on top.

#### Deploy Your App to Railway

##### Setup Domains

We'll need the domains for both the `server` and `client` services:

1. Go to the `server` instance's **Settings** tab, and click **Generate Domain**.
1. Enter `8080` as the port and click **Generate Domain**.
1. Do the same under the `client`'s **Settings**.
1. Copy both domains, as we will need them later.

##### Deploying the Server

You'll deploy the server first:

1. Move into the `.wasp/build` directory:

    ```shell
    cd .wasp/build
    ```

2. Link the `.wasp/build` directory to your newly created Railway project:

    ```shell
    railway link
    ```

    Select `server` when prompted to select a service.

  <!-- TOPIC: env vars -->

3. Go into the Railway dashboard and set up the required env variables:

   Click on the `server` service and go to the **Variables** tab:

   1. Click **Variable reference** and select `DATABASE_URL` (it will populate it with the correct value)

   1. Add `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL` with the `client` domain (e.g. `https://client-production-XXXX.up.railway.app`). `https://` prefix is required!

   1. Add `WASP_SERVER_URL` with the `server` domain (e.g. `https://server-production-XXXX.up.railway.app`). `https://` prefix is required!
   1. Add `JWT_SECRET` with a random string at least 32 characters long<br /><SecretGeneratorBlock />

     <AddExternalAuthEnvVarsReminder />

4. Push and deploy the project:

    ```shell
    railway up --ci
    ```

    <small>

    We use the `--ci` flag to limit the log output to only the build process.
    </small>

    Railway will locate the `Dockerfile` in `.wasp/build` and deploy your server.

##### Deploying the Client

1. Next, go into your app's frontend build directory `.wasp/build/web-app`:

    ```shell
    cd web-app
    ```

2. Create the production build, using the `server` domain as the `REACT_APP_API_URL`:

    ```shell
    npm install && REACT_APP_API_URL=<url_to_wasp_backend> npm run build
    ```

3. Next, we want to link the client build directory to the `client` service:

    ```shell
    cd build
    railway link
    ```

4. Next, deploy the client build to Railway:

    ```shell
    railway up --ci
    ```

    Select `client` when prompted to select a service.

    Railway will detect the `index.html` file and deploy the client as a static site.

And now your Wasp should be deployed!

Back in your [Railway dashboard](https://railway.com/dashboard?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=wasp), click on your project and you should see your newly deployed services: PostgreSQL, Server, and Client.

#### Updates & Redeploying

When you make updates and need to redeploy:

1. Run `wasp build` to rebuild your app.
1. Go into the `.wasp/build` directory and:

    Deploy the server with:
    ```shell
    railway up --ci
    ```
1. Go into the `.wasp/build/web-app` directory and:

    Rebuild the client with:
    ```shell
    npm install && REACT_APP_API_URL=<url_to_wasp_backend> npm run build
    ```
    And then deploy the client with:
    ```shell
    cd build
    railway up --ci
    ```

### Heroku <Server /> <Database /> {#heroku}

We will show how to deploy the server and provision a database for it on Heroku. You can check their [pricing page](https://www.heroku.com/pricing) for more information on their plans.

You will need Heroku account, `heroku` [CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) and `docker` CLI installed to follow these instructions.

Make sure you are logged in with `heroku` CLI. You can check if you are logged in with `heroku whoami`, and if you are not, you can log in with `heroku login`.

#### Set up a Heroku app

:::info
You need to do this only once per Wasp app.
:::

Unless you want to deploy to an existing Heroku app, let's create a new Heroku app:

```
heroku create <app-name>
```

Unless you have an external PostgreSQL database that you want to use, let's create a new database on Heroku and attach it to our app:

```
heroku addons:create --app <app-name> heroku-postgresql:essential-0
```

:::caution

We are using the `essential-0` database instance. It's the cheapest database instance Heroku offers and it costs $5/mo.
:::

Heroku will also set `DATABASE_URL` env var for us at this point. If you are using an external database, you will have to set it up yourself.

The `PORT` env var will also be provided by Heroku, so the ones left to set are the `JWT_SECRET`, `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL` and `WASP_SERVER_URL` env vars:

```
heroku config:set --app <app-name> JWT_SECRET=<random_string_at_least_32_characters_long>
heroku config:set --app <app-name> WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL=<url_of_where_client_will_be_deployed>
heroku config:set --app <app-name> WASP_SERVER_URL=<url_of_where_server_will_be_deployed>
```

We can help you generate a `JWT_SECRET`:<br/><SecretGeneratorBlock />

:::note
If you do not know what your client URL is yet, don't worry. You can set `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL` after you deploy your client.
:::

#### Deploy the Heroku app

After you have [built the app](#1-generating-deployable-code), position yourself in `.wasp/build/` directory:

```shell
cd .wasp/build
```

assuming you were at the root of your Wasp project at that moment.

Log in to Heroku Container Registry:

```shell
heroku container:login
```

Set your app's stack to `container` so we can deploy our app as a Docker container:

```shell
heroku stack:set container --app <app-name>
```

Build the Docker image and push it to Heroku:

```shell
heroku container:push --app <app-name> web
```

App is still not deployed at this point.
This step might take some time, especially the very first time, since there are no cached Docker layers.

Deploy the pushed image and restart the app:

```shell
heroku container:release --app <app-name> web
```

This is it, the backend is deployed at `https://<app-name>-XXXX.herokuapp.com` 🎉

Find out the exact app URL with:

```shell
heroku info --app <app-name>
```

Additionally, you can check out the logs with:

```shell
heroku logs --tail --app <app-name>
```

:::note Using `pg-boss` with Heroku

If you wish to deploy an app leveraging [Jobs](../../advanced/jobs) that use `pg-boss` as the executor to Heroku, you need to set an additional environment variable called [`PG_BOSS_NEW_OPTIONS`](../../advanced/jobs.md#pg_boss_new_options) to `{"connectionString":"<REGULAR_HEROKU_DATABASE_URL>","ssl":{"rejectUnauthorized":false}}`. This is because pg-boss uses the `pg` extension, which does not seem to connect to Heroku over SSL by default, which Heroku requires. Additionally, Heroku uses a self-signed cert, so we must handle that as well.

:::

### Netlify <Client /> {#netlify}

Netlify is a static hosting solution that is free for many use cases. You will need a Netlify account to follow these instructions.

Make sure you are logged in with Netlify CLI. You can check if you are logged in with `npx netlify-cli status`, and if you are not, you can log in with `npx netlify-cli login`.

First, make sure you have [built the Wasp app](#1-generating-deployable-code). We'll build the client web app next.

<BuildingTheWebClient />

We can now deploy the client with:

```shell
npx netlify-cli deploy
```

<small>
  Carefully follow the instructions: decide if you want to create a new app or use an existing one, pick the team under which your app will be deployed etc.
</small>

The final step is to run:

```shell
npx netlify-cli deploy --prod
```

That is it! Your client should be live at `https://<app-name>.netlify.app`.

:::note
Make sure you set the `https://<app-name>.netlify.app` URL as the `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL` environment variable in your server hosting environment.
:::

:::caution Redirecting URLs toward `index.html`
If you follow the instructions above, the Netlify CLI will use `netlify.toml` file that Wasp generates by default in `.wasp/build/web-app/`. This will correctly configure Netlify to redirect URLs toward `index.html`, which is important since Wasp is a Single Page Application (SPA) and needs to handle routing on the client side.

If you instead use another method of deployment to Netlify, for example doing it using CI, make sure that Netlify picks up that `netlify.toml` file, or configure URL redirecting yourself manually on Netlify.

We recommend to deploy using the Netlify CLI in Github Actions. You can find an example Github Action configuration below.
:::

#### Deploying through Github Actions

To enable automatic deployment of the client whenever you push to the `main` branch, you can set up a GitHub Actions workflow. To do this, create a file in your repository at `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Feel free to rename `deploy.yaml` as long as the file type is not changed.

Here’s an example configuration file to help you get started. This example workflow will trigger a deployment to Netlify whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

<details>
  <summary>Example Github Action</summary>

  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I get the Environment Variables?</summary>

  - **`NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`**: For the auth token, you'll generate a new Personal Access Token on [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#obtain-a-token-in-the-netlify-ui).

  - **`NETLIFY_SITE_NAME`**: This is the name of your Netlify project.

  - **`WASP_SERVER_URL`**: This is your server's URL and is generally only available after **deploying the backend**. This variable can be skipped when the backend is not functional or not deployed, but be aware that backend-dependent functionalities may be broken.

  After getting the environment variables, you need to set these in GitHub Repository Secrets.

### Cloudflare <Client /> {#cloudflare}

[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) is a cloud services provider that offers a variety of services, including free static hosting with Cloudflare Pages. You will need a Cloudflare account to follow these instructions.

Make sure you are logged in with the Cloudflare's CLI called Wrangler. You can log in by running:

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

Before you continue, make sure you have [built the Wasp app](#1-generating-deployable-code). We'll build the client web app next.

<BuildingTheWebClient />

To deploy the client, make sure you are positioned in the `.wasp/buld/web-app` folder and then run the following:

```shell
npx wrangler pages deploy ./build --commit-dirty=true --branch=main
```

<small>
  Carefully follow the instructions i.e. do you want to create a new app or use an existing one.
</small>

That is it! Your client should be live at `https://<app-name>.pages.dev`.

:::note
Make sure you set the `https://<app-name>.pages.dev` URL as the `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL` environment variable in your server hosting environment.
:::

:::info Redirecting URLs toward `index.html`

Cloudflare will automatically redirect all paths toward `index.html`, which is important since Wasp's client app is a Single Page Application (SPA) and needs to handle routing on the client side.
:::

#### Deploying through Github Actions

To enable automatic deployment of the client whenever you push to the `main` branch, you can set up a GitHub Actions workflow. To do this, create a file in your repository at `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Feel free to rename `deploy.yaml` as long as the file type is not changed.

Here’s an example configuration file to help you get started. This example workflow will trigger a deployment to Cloudflare Pages whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

<details>
  <summary>Example Github Action</summary>

  ```yaml
  name: Deploy Client to Cloudflare

  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main # Deploy on every push to the main branch

  jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      steps:
        - name: Checkout Code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2

        - name: Setup Node.js
          id: setup-node

      env:
        CLIENT_CLOUDFLARE_APP_NAME: cloudflare-pages-app-name
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I get the Environment Variables?</summary>

  - **`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`**: You can get these from your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens). Make sure to give the token `Cloudflare Pages: Read` and `Cloudflare Pages: Edit` permissions.

  - **`CLIENT_CLOUDFLARE_APP_NAME`**: This is the name of your Cloudflare Pages app. You can create a new Cloudflare Pages app with `npx wrangler pages project create <app-name>`.

  - **`WASP_SERVER_URL`**: This is your server's URL and is generally only available after **deploying the backend**. This variable can be skipped when the backend is not functional or not deployed, but be aware that backend-dependent functionalities may be broken.

  After getting the environment variables, you need to set these in GitHub Repository Secrets.
</details>

## Self-Hosted

If you have your server or rent out a server, you can self-host your Wasp apps. Self-hosting your apps gives you full control over your apps and their data. It can be more cost-effective than a cloud provider since you can deploy multiple apps on a single server. However, you'll need to manage the server yourself, which can be time-consuming and require some technical knowledge.

### What you'll need

To successfully self-host your Wasp app, you need to have the following:

- A server with a public IP address.
  - There are many cloud providers you can use to rent a server. Some popular ones are [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/vps/), and [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/).
- A domain name, for example, `myapp.com` (needed for HTTPS support).

### Self-hosting steps

To self-host your Wasp app, you need to follow these general steps:

1. Get your **app's code** on the server.

   - How you do this depends on your setup, we'll explore a few methods in the next section.

2. Run your **client and server apps** on the server. Run the **database** on the server or use a managed database service.

   - We'll use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to run the server app and the database, but you can run them without Docker if you prefer.

3. Set up a **reverse proxy** on the server to be able to use a domain name with HTTPS for your app.

4. Configure the **env variables** on your server for the server app.

<ImgWithCaption source="/img/deploying/self-hosting.png" alt="One of many possible self-hosting setups" caption="One possible self-hosting setup" />

### Deployment methods

We'll explore a few methods you can use to self-host your Wasp app. The first method is the most straightforward: you manually set up everything on your server. The other two methods require you to install and configure a self-hosted PaaS on your server and then use that to deploy apps to it.

#### Simple setup

In this setup, you do all the steps on the server: you install Docker, set up the server env variable, set up a reverse proxy, and run your app. This is a very manual process, but you'll learn how everything works.

##### Overview of the steps

On your server:

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [Node.js](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [Wasp CLI](/introduction/quick-start.md#installation).
2. Get your **app's source code**.
   - We recommend using Git to clone your app's repository and then pulling the latest changes when you want to deploy a new version. You can use any other method to get your app's code on the server.
3. Build your app with **`wasp build`**.
4. Build and run the **server app**.
   - Wasp gives you a `Dockerfile` in the `.wasp/build` directory that you can use to build and run the server app.
   - We are using Docker to run the server app, but you can run it without Docker if you prefer - just make sure to replicate the setup in the `Dockerfile`.
   - When you run the server app with Docker, you need to setup the server env variables. You can do this with a `.env` file or by passing the env variables directly to the `docker run` command.
5. Start the **database** on the server or use a managed database service.
   - We usually run the database in Docker on the same server, but you can run the database directly on the server.
   - You can also use a managed database service which you can connect to from your server. This is a great option if you don't want to manage the database yourself, but it can be more expensive.
6. Build the **client app** into static files.
   - Wasp outputs the client app in the `.wasp/build/web-app` directory.
   <!-- TODO: we should change this link to the new place where we talk about how the client is built -->
   - You should [build the client app](./paas.md#3-deploying-the-web-client-) into static files.
7. Install and set up a **reverse proxy** to serve your client and server apps.
   - There are many great choices for reverse proxies, like [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), and [Traefik](https://traefik.io/).
   - Make sure to set up the reverse proxy to serve the client app's static files and to proxy requests to the server app.
8. Point your **domain(s)** to your server's IP address.
   - We recommend setting `myapp.com` for the client and `api.myapp.com` for the server.
   - The reverse proxy should serve the client app on `myapp.com` and proxy requests to the server app on `api.myapp.com`. Make sure your [env variables](../env-vars.md) are using these client and server URLs.

Check out one of our step-by-step guides for more details:

#### Coolify

[Coolify](https://coolify.io/) is a deployment tool (self-hosted PaaS) that you run on your server. It makes it easier to deploy multple apps on your server. It has a nice looking UI and it helps you with managing your deployments.

##### Overview of the steps

1. Install [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) on your server.
2. Create your **Coolify apps** (client, server, and database).
   - You can run the database with Coolify on the same server, but you can run the database directly on your server or use a managed database service.
3. In Coolify, set up the **server app env variables**.
   - You can set up the env variables in the Coolify UI, check out which [env variables are required](../env-vars.md).
4. Set up some sort of **CI/CD** (for example [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)) to:
   - build and upload your Docker images,
   - trigger Coolify to pull the Docker images and deploy them.
5. Point your domain to your server's IP address.
   - We recommend setting `myapp.com` for the client and `api.myapp.com` for the server.
   - Make sure to set the domains in the Coolify UI for the client and the server apps.
   - Make sure to set the env variables for the client and the server URLs correctly.

Check out one of our step-by-step guides for more details:

#### CapRover

[CapRover](https://caprover.com/) is a deployment tool (self-hosted PaaS) that you run on your server. It makes it easier to deploy multple apps on your server. It has a nice looking UI and it helps you with managing your deployments.

##### Overview of the steps

1. Install [CapRover](https://caprover.com/) on your server.
2. Create your CapRover apps (client, server, and database).
   - You can run the database with CapRover on the same server, but you can run the database directly on your server or use a managed database service.
3. Set up the server env variables.
   - You can set up the env variables in the CapRover UI, check out which [env variables are required](../env-vars.md).
4. Set up some sort of **CI/CD** (for example [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)) to:
   - build and upload your Docker images to a Docker registry,
   - trigger CapRover to pull the Docker images and deploy them.
5. Point your domain to your server's IP address.
   - We recommend setting `myapp.com` for the client and `api.myapp.com` for the server.
   - Make sure to set the domains in the CapRover UI for the client and the server apps.
   - Make sure to set the env variables for the client and the server URLs correctly.

Check out one of our step-by-step guides for more details:

<GuideLink linkToGuide="https://gist.github.com/infomiho/a853e2f92aff6d52e9120b8974887464" title="Deploying Wasp with Caprover on your server" description="Uses Caprover, Github Actions, Github Container Registry" />

### Database setup

In all of the guides, we run the **database on your server**. When you run the database on your server, you need to take care of backups, updates, and scaling. We suggest setting up [PostgresSQL periodic backups](https://tembo.io/docs/getting-started/postgres_guides/how-to-backup-and-restore-a-postgres-database) and/or taking snapshots of your server's disk. In case something bad happens to your server, you can restore your database from the backups.

If you prefer not to manage the database yourself, you can use a **managed database service**. The service provider takes care of backups, updates, and scaling for you but it can be more expensive than running the database on your server. Some popular managed database services are [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [DigitalOcean Managed Databases](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases/), and [Supabase](https://supabase.io/).

## CI/CD Scenarios

Setting up a CI/CD pipeline is an optional but highly recommended part of deploying applications.

**Continuous Integration (CI)** involves verifying/testing code changes through an automated process whenever code is pushed to the repository. This helps us catch bugs early and make sure that our app works.

**Continuous Deployment (CD)** refers to the automatic deployment of code changes to the production environment. This is commonly know as "push to deploy" and frees developers from having to manually deploy code changes.

### Running tests in CI

#### End to end tests

End to end (e2e) tests simulate real user using your app and you can test different scenarios like login, adding items to cart, etc. Writing end to end tests frees you from
manually testing your app after every change.

**To run e2e tests with Wasp in the CI**, you'll need to:

1. Install Wasp in the CI environment.
2. Run your app (with the database) in the CI environment.
3. Run the e2e tests against the running app.

##### Example app

We'll show you how to run end-to-end tests in CI using the [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as our CI and the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) as our e2e testing framework.

1. Check our example app and its e2e tests in the [e2e-tests](https://github.com/wasp-lang/e2e-test-example/tree/main/e2e-tests) directory.

   You can copy the `e2e-tests` directory to your own project and modify it to fit your app. This will enable you to run the e2e tests locally.

   <details>
     <summary>Example e2e test</summary>

     ```ts
     import { expect, test } from '@playwright/test'
     import { generateRandomUser, logUserIn } from './utils'

     const user = generateRandomUser()

     test.describe('basic user flow test', () => {
       test('log in and add task', async ({ page }) => {
         await logUserIn({ page, user })
         await expect(page).toHaveURL('/')
         await expect(page.locator('body')).toContainText('No tasks yet.')

         // Add a task
         await page.fill('input[name="description"]', 'First task')
         await page.click('input:has-text("Create task")')
         await expect(page.locator('body')).toContainText('First task')
       })
     })
     ```
   </details>

2. To run the tests in the Github Actions CI, you'll need to create a workflow file in your repository.

   You should create a `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` file in your repository. You can copy the contents of the [e2e-tests.yml](https://github.com/wasp-lang/e2e-test-example/blob/main/.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml) file from our example app.

#### Unit tests

Unit tests test pieces of your code logic in isolation. They are much simpler and faster than e2e tests, but they don't simulate the real user interaction with your app.

You can use Wasp's built in [client tests](../project/testing.md) support to test the client side code of your app. You are free to use any testing framework for the server side code.

**You'd run the unit tests in the CI** in a similar way as the e2e tests:

1. Install Wasp in the CI environment.
2. Run the client tests with `wasp test client run`.
3. Run the server tests with your testing framework.

### Continuous deployment

We'll look at two ways you can use the CI/CD pipeline to deploy your Wasp app:

1. Package the server and client with Docker.
2. Deploy the client as static files.

#### Package the server and client with Docker

The most common way to package your app for deployment is using Docker images. This way you can easily deploy the same image to different environments (staging, production, etc.).

**To build the app as a Docker image**, you'll need to:

1. Install Docker in the CD environment.
2. Build the app with `wasp build`.
3. Build the Docker image and push it to a Docker registry:
   - for our server app
   - for our client app
4. For some providers: notify them to deploy the new app version.

:::info What is a Docker Registry?

Docker Registry is a place where you can store your Docker images and then your deployment provider can pull them from there. The most common Docker Registry is the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), but you can also use other registries like the [Github Container Registry (GHCR)](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/about-github-container-registry).

:::

##### Example deployment

We'll take a look at our Coolify deployment example in the [deployment](./deployment-methods/self-hosted.md#coolify) section. We are using Github Actions to build the Docker images and their Github Container Registry (GHCR) to store them.

Let's go through the [deploy.yml](https://gist.github.com/infomiho/ad6fade7396498ae32a931ca563a4524#file-deploy-yml) file in the Coolify guide:

1. First, we **authenticate with the Github Container Registry (GHCR)**.

   We are using the `docker/login-action` action to authenticate with the GHCR.

2. Then, we **prepare the Docker image metadata** for later use.

   We are using the `docker/metadata-action` action to prepare some extra info that we'll use later in the deployment process.

3. Next, we **build the Wasp app** with `wasp build`.

   This gives our server and the client app in the `.wasp/build` folder.

4. Then, we **package the server app** into a Docker image and **push it to the GHCR**.

   We use the `Dockerfile` in the `.wasp/build` directory to build and push the server Docker image using the `docker/build-push-action` action.

5. Next, we create a `Dockerfile` for our client and then **package the client app** into a Docker image and **push it to the GHCR**.

   We create a `Dockerfile` that uses a simple Go static server to serve the client app. We again use the `docker/build-push-action` action to build and push the client Docker image.

6. Finally, we notify Coolify using their Webhook API to **deploy our new app version**.

   And now you can open the [deploy.yml](https://gist.github.com/infomiho/ad6fade7396498ae32a931ca563a4524#file-deploy-yml) file in the Coolify guide and see the full deployment process.

#### Static build of the client

Wasp's client app is a single page application (SPA) which you build into static HTML, CSS, and JS files that you can upload to any hosting provider that supports serving static files. This means that for the client app, you don't need to use Docker images if don't want to. It's usually cheaper to host static files than to host Docker images.

**To deploy the client app as static files**, you'll need to:

1. Build the app with `wasp build` in the CD environment.
2. Build the client app with `npm run build`.
3. Upload the static files to your hosting provider.

Check out our instructions for deploying the client app to [Netlify](./deployment-methods/paas.md#netlify) or [Cloudflare](./deployment-methods/paas.md#cloudflare) where you can check out the example deployment using Github Actions.

## Extras

In this section, we will cover some additional topics that are important for deploying Wasp apps in production.

#### Custom domain setup

If you want to set up a custom domain for your Wasp app, you can do it for both the client and the server.

The important part is setting up the custom domain for the client - that's what your users visit from their browsers. Setting up a custom domain for the server is optional, but it can be useful if you'd like to hide some server details (for example, the IP address or auto-generated domain name) from the users.

##### How to do it?

It's usually a two-step process, and it's the same for both the client and the server:

1. Set up the **DNS records** for the domain.

   This will depend on your hosting provider. You can usually do this by adding an `A` record in your DNS settings that points to the app's IPv4 address. You often set the `AAAA` record for IPv6 address as well. Some hosting providers ask you to set the `CNAME` record instead of the `A` and `AAAA` records.

:::note Using `wasp deploy`?

Check out how to set up custom domains with [Fly.io](./deployment-methods/wasp-deploy/fly.md#custom-domain) or [Railway](./deployment-methods/wasp-deploy/railway.md#custom-domain).

:::

2. Set up the **environment variables** for the app.

   You need to set the environment variables so Wasp configures the app correctly (for example, for CORS to work correctly).

   #### Client domain env vars

   When [building the client](./env-vars.md#client-env-vars), set `REACT_APP_API_URL` to point to your server domain:

   ```bash
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.myapp.com
   ```

   <small>
     Learn more about client configuration in the [env vars section](../project/env-vars.md#client-general-configuration).
   </small>

   #### Server domain env vars

   For the server, you need to [configure two variables](./env-vars.md#server-env-vars):

   - `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL`: Your client app's domain
   - `WASP_SERVER_URL`: Your server domain

   <br />

   ```bash
   WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL=https://myapp.com
   WASP_SERVER_URL=https://server.myapp.com
   ```

   <small>
     Learn more about server env variables in the [env vars section](../project/env-vars.md#server-general-configuration).
   </small>

#### DDoS protection and CDN recommendations

When deploying your Wasp app, you might want to consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and DDoS protection service to improve the performance and security of your app:

1. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** is a network of servers distributed worldwide that caches static assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript files.

   Using a CDN in front of your **client** can help with caching static assets and serving them faster to users around the world. When a user requests a file, the CDN serves it from the server closest to the user, improving load times.

2. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attacks are a common threat to web applications.

   Attackers send a large amount of traffic to your server, overwhelming it and making it unavailable to legitimate users. You can use a DDoS protection service for both your **client and server** to protect your app from these attacks.

We recommend using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for both CDN and DDoS protection. It's easy to set up and provides a free tier that should be enough for most small to medium-sized apps.

There are other CDN providers like [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/), [Bunny](https://bunnycdn.com/) and [Amazon Cloudfront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) that you can consider as well.

#### Are Wasp apps production ready?

As we mentioned in the [introduction](./intro.md) section, what we call **Wasp apps** are three separate pieces: the client, the server, and the database.

For the server, we are using Node.js and the battle-tested Express.js framework. For the database, we are using PostgreSQL, which is a powerful and reliable database system. For the client, we are using React and Vite, which are both widely used and well-maintained.

Each of these pieces is production-ready on its own, and Wasp just makes it easy to connect them together. Keep in mind that Wasp is still considered beta software, so there might be some rough edges here and there.

# Wasp AI

## Creating New App with AI

Wasp comes with its own AI: Wasp AI, aka Mage (**M**agic web **A**pp **GE**nerator).

Wasp AI allows you to create a new Wasp app **from only a title and a short description** (using GPT in the background)!

There are two main ways to create a new Wasp app with Wasp AI:

1. Free, open-source online app [usemage.ai](https://usemage.ai).
2. Running `wasp new` on your machine and picking AI generation. For this you need to provide your own OpenAI API keys, but it allows for more flexibility (choosing GPT models).

They both use the same logic in the background, so both approaches are equally "smart", the difference is just in the UI / settings.

:::info
Wasp AI is an experimental feature. Apps that Wasp AI generates can have mistakes (proportional to their complexity), but even then they can often serve as a great starting point (once you fix the mistakes) or an interesting way to explore how to implement stuff in Wasp.
:::

### usemage.ai

<ImgWithCaption source="img/gpt-wasp/how-it-works.gif" caption="1. Describe your app 2. Pick the color 3. Generate your app 🚀" />

[Mage](https://usemage.ai) is an open-source app with which you can create new Wasp apps from just a short title and description.

It is completely free for you - it uses our OpenAI API keys and we take on the costs.

Once you provide an app title, app description, and choose some basic settings, your new Wasp app will be created for you in a matter of minutes and you will be able to download it to your machine and keep working on it!

If you want to know more, check this [blog post](/blog/2023/07/10/gpt-web-app-generator) for more details on how Mage works, or this [blog post](/blog/2023/07/17/how-we-built-gpt-web-app-generator) for a high-level overview of how we implemented it.

### Wasp CLI

You can create a new Wasp app using Wasp AI by running `wasp new` in your terminal and picking AI generation.

If you don't have them set yet, `wasp` will ask you to provide (via ENV vars) your OpenAI API keys (which it will use to query GPT).

Then, after providing a title and description for your Wasp app, the new app will be generated on your disk!

![wasp-cli-ai-generation](./wasp-ai-2.png)

## Developing Existing App with AI

While Wasp AI doesn't at the moment offer any additional help for developing your Wasp app with AI beyond initial generation, this is something we are exploring actively.

In the meantime, while waiting for Wasp AI to add support for this, we suggest checking out [aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider), which is an AI pair programming tool in your terminal. This is a third-party tool, not affiliated with Wasp in any way, but we and some of Wasp users have found that it can be helpful when working on Wasp apps.

# Advanced Features

## Sending Emails

## Sending Emails

With Wasp's email-sending feature, you can easily integrate email functionality into your web application.

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app Example {
  ...
  emailSender: {
    provider: <provider>,
    defaultFrom: {
      name: "Example",
      email: "hello@itsme.com"
    },
  }
}
```

Choose from one of the providers:

- `Dummy` (development only),
- `Mailgun`,
- `SendGrid`
- or the good old `SMTP`.

Optionally, define the `defaultFrom` field, so you don't need to provide it whenever sending an email.

### Sending Emails

Before jumping into details about setting up various providers, let's see how easy it is to send emails.

You import the `emailSender` that is provided by the `wasp/server/email` module and call the `send` method on it.

```ts title="src/actions/sendEmail.ts" auto-js

// In some action handler...
const info = await emailSender.send({
  from: {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@doe.com",
  },
  to: "user@domain.com",
  subject: "Saying hello",
  text: "Hello world",
  html: "Hello <strong>world</strong>",
});
```

Read more about the `send` method in the [API Reference](#javascript-api).

The `send` method returns an object with the status of the sent email. It varies depending on the provider you use.

### Providers

We'll go over all of the available providers in the next section. For some of them, you'll need to set up some env variables. You can do that in the `.env.server` file.

#### Using the Dummy Provider

<DummyProviderNote />

To speed up development, Wasp offers a `Dummy` email sender that `console.log`s the emails in the console. Since it doesn't send emails for real, it doesn't require any setup.

Set the provider to `Dummy` in your `main.wasp` file.

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app Example {
  ...
  emailSender: {
    provider: Dummy,
  }
}
```

#### Using the SMTP Provider

First, set the provider to `SMTP` in your `main.wasp` file.

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app Example {
  ...
  emailSender: {
    provider: SMTP,
  }
}
```

Then, add the following env variables to your `.env.server` file.

```properties title=".env.server"
SMTP_HOST=
SMTP_USERNAME=
SMTP_PASSWORD=
SMTP_PORT=
```

Many transactional email providers (e.g. Mailgun, SendGrid but also others) can also use SMTP, so you can use them as well.

#### Using the Mailgun Provider

Set the provider to `Mailgun` in the `main.wasp` file.

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app Example {
  ...
  emailSender: {
    provider: Mailgun,
  }
}
```

Then, get the Mailgun API key and domain and add them to your `.env.server` file.

##### Getting the API Key and Domain

1. Go to [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) and create an account.
2. Go to [Domains](https://app.mailgun.com/mg/sending/new-domain) and create a new domain.
3. Copy the domain and add it to your `.env.server` file.
4. Create a new Sending API key under `Send > Sending > Domain settings` and find `Sending API keys`.
5. Copy the API key and add it to your `.env.server` file.

```properties title=".env.server"
MAILGUN_API_KEY=
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=
```

##### Using the EU Region

If your domain region is in the EU, you need to set the `MAILGUN_API_URL` variable in your `.env.server` file:

```properties title=".env.server"
MAILGUN_API_URL=https://api.eu.mailgun.net
```

#### Using the SendGrid Provider

Set the provider field to `SendGrid` in your `main.wasp` file.

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app Example {
  ...
  emailSender: {
    provider: SendGrid,
  }
}
```

Then, get the SendGrid API key and add it to your `.env.server` file.

##### Getting the API Key

1. Go to [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) and create an account.
2. Go to [API Keys](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys) and create a new API key.
3. Copy the API key and add it to your `.env.server` file.

```properties title=".env.server"
SENDGRID_API_KEY=
```

### API Reference

#### `emailSender` dict

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app Example {
  ...
  emailSender: {
    provider: <provider>,
    defaultFrom: {
      name: "Example",
      email: "hello@itsme.com"
    },
  }
}
```

The `emailSender` dict has the following fields:

- `provider: Provider` Required!

  The provider you want to use. Choose from `Dummy`, `SMTP`, `Mailgun` or `SendGrid`.

  <DummyProviderNote />

- `defaultFrom: dict`

  The default sender's details. If you set this field, you don't need to provide the `from` field when sending an email.

#### JavaScript API

Using the `emailSender` in <ShowForTs>Typescript</ShowForTs><ShowForJs>JavaScript</ShowForJs>:

```ts title="src/actions/sendEmail.ts" auto-js

// In some action handler...
const info = await emailSender.send({
  from: {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@doe.com",
  },
  to: "user@domain.com",
  subject: "Saying hello",
  text: "Hello world",
  html: "Hello <strong>world</strong>",
});
```

The `send` method accepts an object with the following fields:

- `from: object`

  The sender's details. If you set up `defaultFrom` field in the `emailSender` dict in Wasp file, this field is optional.

  - `name: string`

    The name of the sender.

  - `email: string`

    The email address of the sender.

- `to: string` Required!

  The recipient's email address.

- `subject: string` Required!

  The subject of the email.

- `text: string` Required!

  The text version of the email.

- `html: string` Required!

  The HTML version of the email

## Recurring Jobs

In most web apps, users send requests to the server and receive responses with some data. When the server responds quickly, the app feels responsive and smooth.

What if the server needs extra time to fully process the request? This might mean sending an email or making a slow HTTP request to an external API. In that case, it's a good idea to respond to the user as soon as possible and do the remaining work in the background.

Wasp supports background jobs that can help you with this:

- Jobs persist between server restarts,
- Jobs can be retried if they fail,
- Jobs can be delayed until a future time,
- Jobs can have a recurring schedule.

### Using Jobs

#### Job Definition and Usage

Let's write an example Job that will print a message to the console and return a list of tasks from the database.

1. Start by creating a Job declaration in your `.wasp` file:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    job mySpecialJob {
      executor: PgBoss,
      perform: {
        fn: import { foo } from "@src/workers/bar"
      },
      entities: [Task],
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    job mySpecialJob {
      executor: PgBoss,
      perform: {
        fn: import { foo } from "@src/workers/bar"
      },
      entities: [Task],
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. After declaring the Job, implement its worker function:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="src/workers/bar.js"
    export const foo = async ({ name }, context) => {
      console.log(`Hello ${name}!`)
      const tasks = await context.entities.Task.findMany({})
      return { tasks }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/workers/bar.ts"
    import { type MySpecialJob } from 'wasp/server/jobs'
    import { type Task } from 'wasp/entities'

    type Input = { name: string; }
    type Output = { tasks: Task[]; }

    export const foo: MySpecialJob<Input, Output> = async ({ name }, context) => {
      console.log(`Hello ${name}!`)
      const tasks = await context.entities.Task.findMany({})
      return { tasks }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info The worker function
The worker function must be an `async` function. The function's return value represents the Job's result.

The worker function accepts two arguments:

- `args`: The data passed into the job when it's submitted.
- `context: { entities }`: The context object containing entities you put in the Job declaration.
  :::

<ShowForTs>
  `MySpecialJob`  is a generic type Wasp generates to help you  correctly type the Job's worker function, ensuring type information about the function's arguments and return value. Read more about type-safe jobs in the [Javascript API section](#javascript-api).
</ShowForTs>

3. After successfully defining the job, you can submit work to be done in your [Operations](../data-model/operations/overview) or [setupFn](../project/server-config#setup-function) (or any other NodeJS code):

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="someAction.js"
    import { mySpecialJob } from 'wasp/server/jobs'

    const submittedJob = await mySpecialJob.submit({ job: "Johnny" })

    // Or, if you'd prefer it to execute in the future, just add a .delay().
    // It takes a number of seconds, Date, or ISO date string.
    await mySpecialJob
      .delay(10)
      .submit({ name: "Johnny" })
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="someAction.ts"
    import { mySpecialJob } from 'wasp/server/jobs'

    const submittedJob = await mySpecialJob.submit({ job: "Johnny" })

    // Or, if you'd prefer it to execute in the future, just add a .delay().
    // It takes a number of seconds, Date, or ISO date string.
    await mySpecialJob
      .delay(10)
      .submit({ name: "Johnny" })
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

And that's it. Your job will be executed by `PgBoss` as if you called `foo({ name: "Johnny" })`.

In our example, `foo` takes an argument, but passing arguments to jobs is not a requirement. It depends on how you've implemented your worker function.

#### Recurring Jobs

If you have work that needs to be done on some recurring basis, you can add a `schedule` to your job declaration:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp {6-9} title="main.wasp"
    job mySpecialJob {
      executor: PgBoss,
      perform: {
        fn: import { foo } from "@src/workers/bar"
      },
      schedule: {
        cron: "0 * * * *",
        args: {=json { "job": "args" } json=} // optional
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp {6-9} title="main.wasp"
    job mySpecialJob {
      executor: PgBoss,
      perform: {
        fn: import { foo } from "@src/workers/bar"
      },
      schedule: {
        cron: "0 * * * *",
        args: {=json { "job": "args" } json=} // optional
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this example, you _don't_ need to invoke anything in <ShowForJs>JavaScript</ShowForJs><ShowForTs>Typescript</ShowForTs>. You can imagine `foo({ job: "args" })` getting automatically scheduled and invoked for you every hour.

<!-- ### Getting the Job's Result

When you submit a job, you get a `SubmittedJob` object back. It has a `jobId` field, which you can use to get the job's result. -->

### Job executors

Wasp supports Jobs through the use of **job executors**. A job executor is responsible for handling the scheduling, monitoring, and execution of jobs.

Currently, Wasp only has support for one job executor, `PgBoss`.

#### `PgBoss` {#pgboss}

[`PgBoss`](https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss/tree/8.4.2) is a lightweight job queue built on top of PostgreSQL. It is suitable for low-volume production use cases and does not require any additional infrastructure or complex management. By using PostgreSQL (and [SKIP LOCKED](https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-locked-for-in-postgresql-9-5/)) as its storage and synchronization mechanism, you get many benefits of a traditional job queue, on top of your existing Postgres database.

##### Requirements

`PgBoss` requires that your database provider is set to `"postgresql"` in your `schema.prisma` file. Read more about setting the provider [here](../data-model/databases.md#postgresql).

##### Limitations

`PgBoss` runs together with your web server, whenever it is up. This means that it is not a separate process or service, but rather a part of your web server's application. As such, it is not suitable for CPU-heavy workloads, as it shares the CPU with your web server's application logic.

The `PgBoss` executor in Wasp does not (yet) support independent, horizontal scaling of pg-boss-only applications, nor starting them as separate workers/processes/threads. This means that your server must be running whenever you want to process jobs. If you need to scale your job processing, you will need to run multiple instances of your web server, each with its own `PgBoss` instance.

##### Customization {#pg_boss_new_options}

If you need to customize the creation of the `PgBoss` instance, you can set an environment variable called `PG_BOSS_NEW_OPTIONS` to a stringified JSON object containing the initialization parameters. See the [pg-boss documentation](https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss/tree/8.4.2/docs#newoptions).

Please note that setting `PG_BOSS_NEW_OPTIONS` environment variable overwrites all Wasp defaults, so you must include the `connectionString` parameter inside it as well.

For example, to set the connection string and change the job archival and deletion settings, you can set the environment variable like this:

```bash
## In an .env file
PG_BOSS_NEW_OPTIONS={"connectionString":"postgresql://user:password@server:5432/database","archiveCompletedAfterSeconds":86400,"deleteAfterDays":30,"maintenanceIntervalMinutes":5}

## In the shell
PG_BOSS_NEW_OPTIONS='{"connectionString":"postgresql://user:password@server:5432/database","archiveCompletedAfterSeconds":86400,"deleteAfterDays":30,"maintenanceIntervalMinutes":5}'
```

You can read more about escaping JSON in environment variables in the [JSON Env Vars documentation](../project/env-vars.md#json-env-vars).

##### Database setup

:::tip You don't need to set up the database manually

When using `PgBoss`, the database setup is automatically taken care of by the Wasp server, and doesn't need to be reflected in your schemas or migrations. The following information is given for your reference, and is explained in more detail in [the `PgBoss` documentation](https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss/blob/8.4.2/docs/readme.md).

:::

All job data will be stored in a separate database schema called `pgboss`. It has some internal tracking tables, such as `job`, `archive`, and `schedule`. `PgBoss` tables have a `name` column in most tables that will correspond to your Job identifier. Additionally, these tables maintain arguments, states, return values, retry information, start and expiration times, and other metadata required by `PgBoss`.

##### Known issues

- **Renaming scheduled jobs**

    The job name/identifier in your `.wasp` file is the same name that will be used in the `name` column of `pgboss` tables. If you change a name that had a `schedule` associated with it, pg-boss will continue scheduling those jobs but they will have no handlers associated, and will thus become stale and expire. To resolve this, you can remove the applicable row from the `pgboss.schedule` table.

    For example, if you renamed a job from `emailReminder` to `sendEmailReminder`, you would need to remove the old scheduled job with the following SQL query:

    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    DELETE FROM pgboss.schedule WHERE name = 'emailReminder';
    COMMIT;
    ```

    **Important:** Only modify the database directly if you're comfortable with SQL operations. If you're unsure, consider keeping the old job name or restarting with a fresh database in development.

##### Job data retention and cleanup

By default, `PgBoss` keeps job data for 12 hours after completion or failure. After that, it moves the data to an archive table, where it is kept for 7 days before being deleted. If you want to change this behavior, you can configure the `PG_BOSS_NEW_OPTIONS` environment variable to set custom values for job archival ([`archivedCompletedAfterSeconds`/`archiveFailedAfterSeconds`](https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss/tree/8.4.2/docs#newoptions:~:text=v1%22%20or%20%22v4%22-,archiveCompletedAfterSeconds,-Specifies%20how%20long)) and removal ([`deleteAfterSeconds`/`deleteAfterMinutes`/etc](https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss/tree/8.4.2/docs#newoptions:~:text=the%20skew%20warnings.-,Archive%20options,-When%20jobs%20in)).

```bash
PG_BOSS_NEW_OPTIONS={"connectionString":"...your postgress connection url...","archiveCompletedAfterSeconds":86400,"deleteAfterDays":30,"maintenanceIntervalMinutes":5}
```

The Job declaration has the following fields:

- `executor: JobExecutor` Required!

  The job executor to use for this job. Currently, the only supported executor is [`PgBoss`](#pgboss).

- `perform: dict` Required!

  - `fn: ExtImport` Required!

    - An `async` function that performs the work. Since Wasp executes Jobs on the server, the import path must lead to a NodeJS file.
    - It receives the following arguments:
      - `args: Input`: The data passed to the job when it's submitted.
      - `context: { entities: Entities }`: The context object containing any declared entities.

    Here's an example of a `perform.fn` function:

      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

  - `executorOptions: dict`

    Executor-specific default options to use when submitting jobs. These are passed directly through and you should consult the documentation for the job executor. These can be overridden during invocation with `submit()` or in a `schedule`.

    - `pgBoss: JSON`

      See the docs for [pg-boss](https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss/blob/8.4.2/docs/readme.md#sendname-data-options).

#### JavaScript API

- Importing a Job:

  <Tabs groupId="js-ts">
    <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
      ```js title="someAction.js"
      import { mySpecialJob } from 'wasp/server/jobs'

    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
      ```ts title="someAction.ts"
      import { mySpecialJob, type MySpecialJob } from 'wasp/server/jobs'
      ```

      :::info Type-safe jobs
      Wasp generates a generic type for each Job declaration, which you can use to type your `perform.fn` function. The type is named after the job declaration, and is available in the `wasp/server/jobs` module. In the example above, the type is `MySpecialJob`.

      The type takes two type arguments:

      - `Input`: The type of the `args` argument of the `perform.fn` function.
      - `Output`: The type of the return value of the `perform.fn` function.
        :::
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

- `submit(jobArgs, executorOptions)`

  - `jobArgs: Input`
  - `executorOptions: object`

  Submits a Job to be executed by an executor, optionally passing in a JSON job argument your job handler function receives, and executor-specific submit options.

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="someAction.js"
    const submittedJob = await mySpecialJob.submit({ job: "args" })
    ```

    ```js title="someAction.ts"
    const submittedJob = await mySpecialJob.submit({ job: "args" })
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

- `delay(startAfter)`

  - `startAfter: int | string | Date` Required!

  Delaying the invocation of the job handler. The delay can be one of:

  - Integer: number of seconds to delay. \[Default 0]
  - String: ISO date string to run at.
  - Date: Date to run at.

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```js title="someAction.js"
    const submittedJob = await mySpecialJob
      .delay(10)
      .submit({ job: "args" }, { "retryLimit": 2 })
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

##### Tracking

The return value of `submit()` is an instance of `SubmittedJob`, which has the following fields:

- `jobId`: The ID for the job in that executor.
- `jobName`: The name of the job you used in your `.wasp` file.
- `executorName`: The Symbol of the name of the job executor.

There are also some namespaced, job executor-specific objects.

- For pg-boss, you may access: `pgBoss`
  - `details()`: pg-boss specific job detail information. [Reference](https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss/blob/8.4.2/docs/readme.md#getjobbyidid)
  - `cancel()`: attempts to cancel a job. [Reference](https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss/blob/8.4.2/docs/readme.md#cancelid)
  - `resume()`: attempts to resume a canceled job. [Reference](https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss/blob/8.4.2/docs/readme.md#resumeid)

## Web Sockets

Wasp provides a fully integrated WebSocket experience by utilizing [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) on the client and server.

We handle making sure your URLs are correctly setup, CORS is enabled, and provide a useful `useSocket` and `useSocketListener` abstractions for use in React components.

To get started, you need to:

1. Define your WebSocket logic on the server.
2. Enable WebSockets in your Wasp file, and connect it with your server logic.
3. Use WebSockets on the client, in React, via `useSocket` and `useSocketListener`.
4. Optionally, type the WebSocket events and payloads for full-stack type safety.

Let's go through setting up WebSockets step by step, starting with enabling WebSockets in your Wasp file.

### Turn On WebSockets in Your Wasp File

We specify that we are using WebSockets by adding `webSocket` to our `app` and providing the required `fn`. You can optionally change the auto-connect behavior.

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="todoApp.wasp"
    app todoApp {
      // ...

      webSocket: {
        fn: import { webSocketFn } from "@src/webSocket",
        autoConnect: true, // optional, default: true
      },
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp title="todoApp.wasp"
    app todoApp {
      // ...

      webSocket: {
        fn: import { webSocketFn } from "@src/webSocket",
        autoConnect: true, // optional, default: true
      },
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Defining the Events Handler

Let's define the WebSockets server with all of the events and handler functions.

<ShowForTs>
  :::info Full-stack type safety
  Check this out: we'll define the event types and payloads on the server, and they will be **automatically exposed on the client**. This helps you avoid mistakes when emitting events or handling them.
  :::
</ShowForTs>

#### `webSocketFn` Function

On the server, you will get Socket.IO `io: Server` argument and `context` for your WebSocket function. The `context` object give you access to all of the entities from your Wasp app.

You can use this `io` object to register callbacks for all the regular [Socket.IO events](https://socket.io/docs/v4/server-api/).  Also, if a user is logged in, you will have a `socket.data.user` on the server.

This is how we can define our `webSocketFn` function:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```ts title="src/webSocket.js"
    import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid'

    export const webSocketFn = (io, context) => {
      io.on('connection', (socket) => {
        const username = socket.data.user?.getFirstProviderUserId() ?? 'Unknown'
        console.log('a user connected: ', username)

        socket.on('chatMessage', async (msg) => {
          console.log('message: ', msg)
          io.emit('chatMessage', { id: uuidv4(), username, text: msg })
          // You can also use your entities here:
          // await context.entities.SomeEntity.create({ someField: msg })
        })
      })
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```ts title="src/webSocket.ts"
    import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid'
    import { type WebSocketDefinition, type WaspSocketData } from 'wasp/server/webSocket'

    export const webSocketFn: WebSocketFn = (io, context) => {
      io.on('connection', (socket) => {
        const username = socket.data.user?.getFirstProviderUserId() ?? 'Unknown'
        console.log('a user connected: ', username)

        socket.on('chatMessage', async (msg) => {
          console.log('message: ', msg)
          io.emit('chatMessage', { id: uuidv4(), username, text: msg })
          // You can also use your entities here:
          // await context.entities.SomeEntity.create({ someField: msg })
        })
      })
    }

    // Typing our WebSocket function with the events and payloads
    // allows us to get type safety on the client as well

    type WebSocketFn = WebSocketDefinition<
      ClientToServerEvents,
      ServerToClientEvents,
      InterServerEvents,
      SocketData
    >

    interface ServerToClientEvents {
      chatMessage: (msg: { id: string, username: string, text: string }) => void;
    }

    interface ClientToServerEvents {
      chatMessage: (msg: string) => void;
    }

    interface InterServerEvents {}

    // Data that is attached to the socket.
    // NOTE: Wasp automatically injects the JWT into the connection,
    // and if present/valid, the server adds a user to the socket.
    interface SocketData extends WaspSocketData {}
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Using the WebSocket On The Client

<ShowForTs>
  :::info Full-stack type safety
  All the hooks we use are typed with the events and payloads you defined on the server. VS Code will give you autocomplete for the events and payloads, and you will get type errors if you make a mistake.
  :::
</ShowForTs>

#### The `useSocket` Hook

Client access to WebSockets is provided by the `useSocket` hook. It returns:

- `socket: Socket` for sending and receiving events.
- `isConnected: boolean` for showing a display of the Socket.IO connection status.
  - Note: Wasp automatically connects and establishes a WebSocket connection from the client to the server by default, so you do not need to explicitly `socket.connect()` or `socket.disconnect()`.
  - If you set `autoConnect: false` in your Wasp file, then you should call these as needed.

All components using `useSocket` share the same underlying `socket`.

#### The `useSocketListener` Hook

Additionally, there is a `useSocketListener: (event, callback) => void` hook which is used for registering event handlers. It takes care of unregistering the handler on unmount.

    Wasp's **full-stack type safety** kicks in here: all the event types and payloads are automatically inferred from the server and are available on the client.

### API Reference

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp title="todoApp.wasp"
    app todoApp {
      // ...

      webSocket: {
        fn: import { webSocketFn } from "@src/webSocket",
        autoConnect: true, // optional, default: true
      },
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

    app todoApp {
      // ...

      webSocket: {

        autoConnect: true, // optional, default: true
      },
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `webSocket` dict has the following fields:

- `fn: WebSocketFn` Required!

  The function that defines the WebSocket events and handlers.

- `autoConnect: bool`

  Whether to automatically connect to the WebSocket server. Default: `true`.

## Accessing the configuration

Whenever you start a Wasp app, you are starting two processes.

- **The client process** - A React app that implements your app's frontend.

  During development, this is a dev server with hot reloading. In production,
  it's a simple process that serves pre-built static files with environment variables
  embedded during the build (details depend on [how you deploy it](../deployment/intro.md)).

- **The server process** - An Express server that implements your app's backend.

  During development, this is an Express server controlled by a
  [`nodemon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) process that takes care of
  hot reloading and restarts. In production, it's a regular Express server run
  using Node.

Check [the introduction](/introduction/introduction.md) for a more in-depth explanation of Wasp's runtime architecture.

You can configure both processes through environment variables. See [the deployment instructions](../project/env-vars.md) for a full list of supported variables.

Wasp gives you runtime access to the processes' configurations through **configuration objects**.

### Server configuration object

The server configuration object contains these fields:

- `frontendUrl: String` - Set it with env var `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL`.

  The URL of your client (the app's frontend).<br />
  Wasp automatically sets it during development when you run `wasp start`.<br />
  In production, you should set it to your client's URL as the server sees it
  (i.e., with the DNS and proxies considered).

You can access it like this:

```js

console.log(config.frontendUrl)
```

### Client configuration object

The client configuration object contains these fields:

- `apiUrl: String` - Set it with env var `REACT_APP_API_URL`

  The URL of your server (the app's backend).<br />
  Wasp automatically sets it during development when you run `wasp start`.<br />
  In production, it should contain the value of your server's URL as the user's browser
  sees it (i.e., with the DNS and proxies considered).

You can access it like this:

```js

console.log(config.apiUrl)
```

## Custom HTTP API Endpoints

In Wasp, the default client-server interaction mechanism is through [Operations](../data-model/operations/overview). However, if you need a specific URL method/path, or a specific response, Operations may not be suitable for you. For these cases, you can use an `api`. Best of all, they should look and feel very familiar.

### How to Create an API

APIs are used to tie a JS function to a certain endpoint e.g. `POST /something/special`. They are distinct from Operations and have no client-side helpers (like `useQuery`).

To create a Wasp API, you must:

1. Declare the API in Wasp using the `api` declaration
2. Define the API's NodeJS implementation

After completing these two steps, you'll be able to call the API from the client code (via our `Axios` wrapper), or from the outside world.

#### Declaring the API in Wasp

First, we need to declare the API in the Wasp file and you can easily do this with the `api` declaration:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
// ...

api fooBar { // APIs and their implementations don't need to (but can) have the same name.
  fn: import { fooBar } from "@src/apis",
  httpRoute: (GET, "/foo/bar")
}
```

Read more about the supported fields in the [API Reference](#api-reference).

#### Defining the API's NodeJS Implementation

<ShowForTs>
  :::note
  To make sure the Wasp compiler generates the types for APIs for use in the NodeJS implementation, you should add your `api` declarations to your `.wasp` file first _and_ keep the `wasp start` command running.
  :::
</ShowForTs>

After you defined the API, it should be implemented as a NodeJS function that takes three arguments:

1. `req`: Express Request object
2. `res`: Express Response object
3. `context`: An additional context object **injected into the API by Wasp**. This object contains user session information, as well as information about entities. The examples here won't use the context for simplicity purposes. You can read more about it in the [section about using entities in APIs](#using-entities-in-apis).

```ts title="src/apis.ts" auto-js

export const fooBar: FooBar = (req, res, context) => {
  res.set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"); // Example of modifying headers to override Wasp default CORS middleware.
  res.json({ msg: `Hello, ${context.user ? "registered user" : "stranger"}!` });
};
```

<ShowForTs>
  :::note
  The `FooBar` type is generated by Wasp based on the `api` declaration above.
  :::

  #### Providing Extra Type Information

  We'll see how we can provide extra type information to an API function.

  Let's say you wanted to create some `GET` route that would take an email address as a param, and provide them the answer to "Life, the Universe and Everything." 😀 What would this look like in TypeScript?

  Define the API in Wasp:

  ```wasp title="main.wasp"
  api fooBar {
    fn: import { fooBar } from "@src/apis",
    entities: [Task],
    httpRoute: (GET, "/foo/bar/:email")
  }
  ```

  We can use the `FooBar` type to which we'll provide the generic **params** and **response** types, which then gives us full type safety in the implementation.

  ```ts title="src/apis.ts"
  import { FooBar } from "wasp/server/api";

  export const fooBar: FooBar<
    { email: string }, // params
    { answer: number } // response
  > = (req, res, _context) => {
    console.log(req.params.email);
    res.json({ answer: 42 });
  };
  ```
</ShowForTs>

### Using the API

#### Using the API externally

To use the API externally, you simply call the endpoint using the method and path you used.

For example, if your app is running at `https://example.com` then from the above you could issue a `GET` to `https://example/com/foo/callback` (in your browser, Postman, `curl`, another web service, etc.).

#### Using the API from the Client

To use the API from your client, including with auth support, you can import the Axios wrapper from `wasp/client/api` and invoke a call. For example:

```tsx title="src/pages/SomePage.tsx" auto-js with-hole

async function fetchCustomRoute() {
  const res = await api.get("/foo/bar");
  console.log(res.data);
}

export const Foo = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchCustomRoute();
  }, []);

  return <>{$HOLE$}</>;
};
```

##### Making Sure CORS Works

APIs are designed to be as flexible as possible, hence they don't utilize the default middleware like Operations do. As a result, to use these APIs on the client side, you must ensure that CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is enabled.

You can do this by defining custom middleware for your APIs in the Wasp file.

For example, an `apiNamespace` is a simple declaration used to apply some `middlewareConfigFn` to all APIs under some specific path:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
apiNamespace fooBar {
  middlewareConfigFn: import { fooBarNamespaceMiddlewareFn } from "@src/apis",
  path: "/foo"
}
```

And then in the implementation file (returning the default config):

```ts title="src/apis.ts" auto-js

export const apiMiddleware: MiddlewareConfigFn = (config) => {
  return config;
};
```

We are returning the default middleware which enables CORS for all APIs under the `/foo` path.

For more information about middleware configuration, please see: [Middleware Configuration](../advanced/middleware-config)

### Using Entities in APIs

In many cases, resources used in APIs will be [Entities](../data-model/entities.md).
To use an Entity in your API, add it to the `api` declaration in Wasp:

```wasp {3} title="main.wasp"
api fooBar {
  fn: import { fooBar } from "@src/apis",
  entities: [Task],
  httpRoute: (GET, "/foo/bar")
}
```

Wasp will inject the specified Entity into the APIs `context` argument, giving you access to the Entity's Prisma API:

```ts title="src/apis.ts" auto-js

export const fooBar: FooBar = async (req, res, context) => {
  res.json({ count: await context.entities.Task.count() });
};
```

The object `context.entities.Task` exposes `prisma.task` from [Prisma's CRUD API](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/crud).

### API Reference

```wasp title="main.wasp"
api fooBar {
  fn: import { fooBar } from "@src/apis",
  httpRoute: (GET, "/foo/bar"),
  entities: [Task],
  auth: true,
  middlewareConfigFn: import { apiMiddleware } from "@src/apis"
}
```

The `api` declaration has the following fields:

- `fn: ExtImport` Required!

  The import statement of the APIs NodeJs implementation.

- `httpRoute: (HttpMethod, string)` Required!

  The HTTP (method, path) pair, where the method can be one of:

  - `ALL`, `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` or `DELETE`
  - and path is an Express path `string`.

- `entities: [Entity]`

  A list of entities you wish to use inside your API. You can read more about it [here](#using-entities-in-apis).

- `auth: bool`

  If auth is enabled, this will default to `true` and provide a `context.user` object. If you do not wish to attempt to parse the JWT in the Authorization Header, you should set this to `false`.

- `middlewareConfigFn: ExtImport`

  The import statement to an Express middleware config function for this API. See more in [middleware section](../advanced/middleware-config) of the docs.

## Configuring Middleware

Wasp comes with a minimal set of useful Express middleware in every application. While this is good for most users, we realize some may wish to add, modify, or remove some of these choices both globally, or on a per-`api`/path basis.

### Default Global Middleware 🌍

Wasp's Express server has the following middleware by default:

- [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/): Helmet helps you secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers. _It's not a silver bullet, but it's a good start._
- [CORS](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#readme): CORS is a package for providing a middleware that can be used to enable [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) with various options.

  :::note
  CORS middleware is required for the frontend to communicate with the backend.
  :::
- [Morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan#readme): HTTP request logger middleware.
- [express.json](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#express.json) (which uses [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser#bodyparserjsonoptions)): parses incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, making the result available under the `req.body` property.

  :::note
  JSON middleware is required for [Operations](../data-model/operations/overview) to function properly.
  :::
- [express.urlencoded](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#express.urlencoded) (which uses [body-parser](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/body-parser.html#bodyparserurlencodedoptions)): returns middleware that only parses urlencoded bodies and only looks at requests where the `Content-Type` header matches the type option.
- [cookieParser](https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-parser#readme): parses Cookie header and populates `req.cookies` with an object keyed by the cookie names.

### Customization

You have three places where you can customize middleware:

1. [global](#1-customize-global-middleware): here, any changes will apply by default _to all operations (`query` and `action`) and `api`._ This is helpful if you wanted to add support for multiple domains to CORS, for example.

:::caution Modifying global middleware
Please treat modifications to global middleware with extreme care as they will affect all operations and APIs. If you are unsure, use one of the other two options.
:::

2. [per-api](#2-customize-api-specific-middleware): you can override middleware for a specific api route (e.g. `POST /webhook/callback`). This is helpful if you want to disable JSON parsing for some callback, for example.
3. [per-path](#3-customize-per-path-middleware): this is helpful if you need to customize middleware for all methods under a given path.
   - It's helpful for things like "complex CORS requests" which may need to apply to both `OPTIONS` and `GET`, or to apply some middleware to a _set of `api` routes_.

        middlewareConfigFn: import { serverMiddlewareFn } from "@src/serverSetup"
      },
    }
    ```

    ```ts title="src/serverSetup.ts"
    import cors from 'cors'
    import { config, type MiddlewareConfigFn } from 'wasp/server'

    export const serverMiddlewareFn: MiddlewareConfigFn = (middlewareConfig) => {
      // Example of adding an extra domains to CORS.
      middlewareConfig.set('cors', cors({ origin: [config.frontendUrl, 'https://example1.com', 'https://example2.com'] }))
      return middlewareConfig
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Customize `api`-specific Middleware

If you would like to modify the middleware for a single API, you can do something like:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp {5} title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    api webhookCallback {
      fn: import { webhookCallback } from "@src/apis",
      middlewareConfigFn: import { webhookCallbackMiddlewareFn } from "@src/apis",
      httpRoute: (POST, "/webhook/callback"),
      auth: false
    }
    ```

    ```ts title="src/apis.js"
    import express from 'express'

    export const webhookCallback = (req, res, _context) => {
      res.json({ msg: req.body.length })
    }

    export const webhookCallbackMiddlewareFn = (middlewareConfig) => {
      console.log('webhookCallbackMiddlewareFn: Swap express.json for express.raw')

      middlewareConfig.delete('express.json')
      middlewareConfig.set('express.raw', express.raw({ type: '*/*' }))

      return middlewareConfig
    }

    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp {5} title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    api webhookCallback {
      fn: import { webhookCallback } from "@src/apis",
      middlewareConfigFn: import { webhookCallbackMiddlewareFn } from "@src/apis",
      httpRoute: (POST, "/webhook/callback"),
      auth: false
    }
    ```

    ```ts title="src/apis.ts"
    import express from 'express'
    import { type WebhookCallback } from 'wasp/server/api'
    import { type MiddlewareConfigFn } from 'wasp/server'

    export const webhookCallback: WebhookCallback = (req, res, _context) => {
      res.json({ msg: req.body.length })
    }

    export const webhookCallbackMiddlewareFn: MiddlewareConfigFn = (middlewareConfig) => {
      console.log('webhookCallbackMiddlewareFn: Swap express.json for express.raw')

      middlewareConfig.delete('express.json')
      middlewareConfig.set('express.raw', express.raw({ type: '*/*' }))

      return middlewareConfig
    }

    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
This gets installed on a per-method basis. Behind the scenes, this results in code like:

```js
router.post('/webhook/callback', webhookCallbackMiddleware, ...)
```

:::

### 3. Customize Per-Path Middleware

If you would like to modify the middleware for all API routes under some common path, you can define a `middlewareConfigFn` on an `apiNamespace`:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```wasp {4} title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    apiNamespace fooBar {
      middlewareConfigFn: import { fooBarNamespaceMiddlewareFn } from "@src/apis",
      path: "/foo/bar"
    }
    ```

    ```ts title="src/apis.js"
    export const fooBarNamespaceMiddlewareFn = (middlewareConfig) => {
      const customMiddleware = (_req, _res, next) => {
        console.log('fooBarNamespaceMiddlewareFn: custom middleware')
        next()
      }

      middlewareConfig.set('custom.middleware', customMiddleware)

      return middlewareConfig
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```wasp {4} title="main.wasp"
    // ...

    apiNamespace fooBar {
      middlewareConfigFn: import { fooBarNamespaceMiddlewareFn } from "@src/apis",
      path: "/foo/bar"
    }
    ```

    ```ts title="src/apis.ts"
    import express from 'express'
    import { type MiddlewareConfigFn } from 'wasp/server'

    export const fooBarNamespaceMiddlewareFn: MiddlewareConfigFn = (middlewareConfig) => {
      const customMiddleware: express.RequestHandler = (_req, _res, next) => {
        console.log('fooBarNamespaceMiddlewareFn: custom middleware')
        next()
      }

      middlewareConfig.set('custom.middleware', customMiddleware)

      return middlewareConfig
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
This gets installed at the router level for the path. Behind the scenes, this results in something like:

```js
router.use('/foo/bar', fooBarNamespaceMiddleware)
```

:::

## Type-Safe Links

If you are using Typescript, you can use Wasp's custom `Link` component to create type-safe links to other pages on your site.

### Using the `Link` Component

After you defined a route:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
route TaskRoute { path: "/task/:id", to: TaskPage }
page TaskPage { ... }
```

You can get the benefits of type-safe links by using the `Link` component from `wasp/client/router`:

```jsx title="TaskList.tsx"

export const TaskList = () => {
  // ...

  return (
    <div>
      {tasks.map((task) => (
        <Link
          key={task.id}
          to="/task/:id"
          {/* 👆 You must provide a valid path here */}
          params={{ id: task.id }}>
          {/* 👆 All the params must be correctly passed in */}
          {task.description}
        </Link>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### Catch-all Routes

If a route path ends with a `/*` pattern (also known as [splat](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/route#splats)), you can use the `Link` component like this:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
route CatchAllRoute { path: "/pages/*", to: CatchAllPage }
page CatchAllPage { ... }
```

```jsx title="TaskList.tsx"
<Link to="/pages/*" params={{ '*': 'about' }}>
  About
</Link>
```

This will result in a link like this: `/pages/about`.

#### Optional Static Segments

If a route contains optional static segments, you'll need to specify one of the possible paths:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
route OptionalRoute { path: "/task/:id/details?", to: OptionalPage }
page OptionalPage { ... }
```

```jsx title="TaskList.tsx"
/* You can include ... */
<Link to="/task/:id/details" params={{ id: 1 }}>
  Task 1
</Link>

/* ... or exclude the optional segment */
<Link to="/task/:id" params={{ id: 1 }}>
  Task 1
</Link>
```

#### Using Search Query & Hash

You can also pass `search` and `hash` props to the `Link` component:

```tsx title="TaskList.tsx"
<Link
  to="/task/:id"
  params={{ id: task.id }}
  search={{ sortBy: 'date' }}
  hash="comments"
>
  {task.description}
</Link>
```

This will result in a link like this: `/task/1?sortBy=date#comments`. Check out the [API Reference](#link-component) for more details.

### The `routes` Object

You can also get all the pages in your app with the `routes` object:

```jsx title="TaskList.tsx"

const linkToTask = routes.TaskRoute.build({ params: { id: 1 } })
```

This will result in a link like this: `/task/1`.

#### Optional Static Segments

If a route contains optional static segments, you'll need to specify one of the possible paths:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
route OptionalRoute { path: "/task/:id/details?", to: OptionalPage }
page OptionalPage { ... }
```

```tsx title="TaskList.tsx"
const linkToOptional = routes.OptionalRoute.build({
  path: '/task/:id/details', // or '/task/:id'
  params: { id: 1 },
})
```

You can also pass `search` and `hash` props to the `build` function. Check out the [API Reference](#routes-object) for more details.

### API Reference

#### `Link` Component

The `Link` component accepts the following props:

- `to` Required!

  - A valid Wasp Route path from your `main.wasp` file.

    In the case of optional static segments, you must provide one of the possible paths which include or exclude the optional segment. For example, if the path is `/task/:id/details?`, you must provide either `/task/:id/details` or `/task/:id`.

- `params: { [name: string]: string | number }` Required! (if the path contains params)

  - An object with keys and values for each param in the path.
  - For example, if the path is `/task/:id`, then the `params` prop must be `{ id: 1 }`. Wasp supports required and optional params.

- `search: string[][] | Record<string, string> | string | URLSearchParams`

  - Any valid input for `URLSearchParams` constructor.
  - For example, the object `{ sortBy: 'date' }` becomes `?sortBy=date`.

- `hash: string`

- all other props that the `react-router-dom`'s [Link](https://reactrouter.com/en/6.26.1/components/link) component accepts

#### `routes` Object

The `routes` object contains a function for each route in your app.

```ts title="router.tsx"
export const routes = {
  // RootRoute has a path like "/"
  RootRoute: {
    build: (options?: {
      search?: string[][] | Record<string, string> | string | URLSearchParams
      hash?: string
    }) => // ...
  },

  // DetailRoute has a path like "/task/:id/:userId?"
  DetailRoute: {
    build: (
      options: {
        params: { id: ParamValue; userId?: ParamValue; },
        search?: string[][] | Record<string, string> | string | URLSearchParams
        hash?: string
      }
    ) => // ...
  },

  // OptionalRoute has a path like "/task/:id/details?"
  OptionalRoute: {
    build: (
      options: {
        path: '/task/:id/details' | '/task/:id',
        params: { id: ParamValue },
        search?: string[][] | Record<string, string> | string | URLSearchParams
        hash?: string
      }
    ) => // ...
  },

  // CatchAllRoute has a path like "/pages/*"
  CatchAllRoute: {
    build: (
      options: {
        params: { '*': ParamValue },
        search?: string[][] | Record<string, string> | string | URLSearchParams
        hash?: string
      }
    ) => // ...
  },
}
```

The `params` object is required if the route contains params. The `search` and `hash` parameters are optional.

You can use the `routes` object like this:

```tsx

const linkToRoot = routes.RootRoute.build()
const linkToTask = routes.DetailRoute.build({ params: { id: 1 } })
const linkToOptional = routes.DetailRoute.build({
  path: '/task/:id/details',
  params: { id: 1 },
})
const linkToCatchAll = routes.CatchAllRoute.build({
  params: { '*': 'about' },
})
```

# General

## Wasp Language (.wasp)

Wasp language (what you write in .wasp files) is a declarative, statically typed, domain-specific language (DSL).

:::tip Wasp TS config \[Early-preview feature]
If you wish, you can alternatively define your [Wasp config in TS](./wasp-ts-config.md) (`main.wasp.ts`) instead of `main.wasp`.
:::

It is a quite simple language, closer to JSON, CSS or SQL than to e.g. Javascript or Python, since it is not a general programming language, but more of a configuration language.

It is pretty intuitive to learn (there isn't much to learn really!) and you can probably do just fine without reading this page and learning from the rest of the docs as you go, but if you want a bit more formal definition and deeper understanding of how it works, then read on!

### Declarations

The central point of Wasp language are **declarations**, and Wasp code is at the end just a bunch of declarations, each of them describing a part of your web app.

```wasp
app MyApp {
  title: "My app"
}

route RootRoute { path: "/", to: DashboardPage }

page DashboardPage {
  component: import { DashboardPage } from "@src/Dashboard.jsx"
}
```

In the example above we described a web app via three declarations: `app MyApp { ... }`, `route RootRoute { ... }` and `page DashboardPage { ... }`.

Syntax for writing a declaration is `<declaration_type> <declaration_name> <declaration_body>`, where:

- `<declaration_type>` is one of the declaration types offered by Wasp (`app`, `route`, ...)
- `<declaration_name>` is an identifier chosen by you to name this specific declaration
- `<declaration_body>` is the value/definition of the declaration itself, which has to match the specific declaration body type expected by the chosen declaration type.

So, for `app` declaration above, we have:

- declaration type `app`
- declaration name `MyApp` (we could have used any other identifier, like `foobar`, `foo_bar`, or `hi3Ho`)
- declaration body `{ title: "My app" }`, which is a dictionary with field `title` that has string value.
  Type of this dictionary is in line with the declaration body type of the `app` declaration type.
  If we provided something else, e.g. changed `title` to `little`, we would get a type error from Wasp compiler since that does not match the expected type of the declaration body for `app`.

Each declaration has a meaning behind it that describes how your web app should behave and function.

All the other types in Wasp language (primitive types (`string`, `number`), composite types (`dict`, `list`), enum types (`DbSystem`), ...) are used to define the declaration bodies.

### Complete List of Wasp Types

Wasp's type system can be divided into two main categories of types: **fundamental types** and **domain types**.

While fundamental types are here to be basic building blocks of a language and are very similar to what you would see in other popular languages, domain types are what make Wasp special, as they model the concepts of a web app like `page`, `route` and similar.

- Fundamental types ([source of truth](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/main/waspc/src/Wasp/Analyzer/Type.hs))
  - Primitive types
    - **string** (`"foo"`, `"they said: \"hi\""`)
    - **bool** (`true`, `false`)
    - **number** (`12`, `14.5`)
    - **declaration reference** (name of existing declaration: `TaskPage`, `updateTask`)
    - **ExtImport** (external import) (`import Foo from "@src/bar.js"`, `import { Smth } from "@src/a/b.js"`)
      - The path has to start with "@src". The rest is relative to the `src` directory.
      - Import has to be a default import `import Foo` or a single named import `import { Foo }`.
    - **json** (`{=json { a: 5, b: ["hi"] } json=}`)
  - Composite types
    - **dict** (dictionary) (`{ a: 5, b: "foo" }`)
    - **list** (`[1, 2, 3]`)
    - **tuple** (`(1, "bar")`, `(2, 4, true)`)
      - Tuples can be of size 2, 3 and 4.
- Domain types ([source of truth](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/main/waspc/src/Wasp/Analyzer/StdTypeDefinitions.hs))
  - Declaration types
    - **action**
    - **api**
    - **apiNamespace**
    - **app**
    - **job**
    - **page**
    - **query**
    - **route**
    - **crud**
  - Enum types
    - **DbSystem**
    - **HttpMethod**
    - **JobExecutor**
    - **EmailProvider**
  - Models from the `schema.prisma` file
    - You can reference models defined in the `schema.prisma` file in your Wasp file by using the model name e.g. `Task`.

You can find more details about each of the domain types, both regarding their body types and what they mean, in the corresponding doc pages covering their features.

## CLI Reference

This guide provides an overview of the Wasp CLI commands, arguments, and options.

### Overview

Once [installed](../quick-start), you can use the wasp command from your command line.

If you run the `wasp` command without any arguments, it will show you a list of available commands and their descriptions:

```

### Commands

#### Creating a New Project

- Use `wasp new` to start the interactive mode for setting up a new Wasp project.

This will prompt you to input the project name and to select a template. The chosen template will then be used to generate the project directory with the specified name.

```
$ wasp new
Enter the project name (e.g. my-project) ▸ MyFirstProject
Choose a starter template
[1] basic (default)
    Simple starter template with a single page.
[2] todo-ts
    Simple but well-rounded Wasp app implemented with Typescript & full-stack type safety.
[3] saas
    Everything a SaaS needs! Comes with Auth, ChatGPT API, Tailwind, Stripe payments and more. Check out https://opensaas.sh/ for more details.
[4] embeddings
    Comes with code for generating vector embeddings and performing vector similarity search.
[5] ai-generated
    🤖 Describe an app in a couple of sentences and have Wasp AI generate initial code for you. (experimental)
▸ 1

🐝 --- Creating your project from the "basic" template... -------------------------

Created new Wasp app in ./MyFirstProject directory!

To run your new app, do:
    cd MyFirstProject
    wasp db start
```

- To skip the interactive mode and create a new Wasp project with the default template, use `wasp new <project-name>`.

```
$ wasp new MyFirstProject

🐝 --- Creating your project from the "basic" template... -------------------------

Created new Wasp app in ./MyFirstProject directory!

To run your new app, do:
cd MyFirstProject
wasp db start
```

#### Project Commands
- `wasp start` launches the Wasp app in development mode. It automatically opens a browser tab with your application running and watches for any changes to .wasp or files in `src/` to automatically reflect in the browser. It also shows messages from the web app, the server and the database on stdout/stderr.
- `wasp start db` starts the database for you. This can be very handy since you don't need to spin up your own database or provide its connection URL to the Wasp app.
- `wasp clean` removes all generated code and other cached artifacts. If using SQlite, it also deletes the SQlite database. Think of this as the Wasp version of the classic "turn it off and on again" solution.

```

$ wasp clean

🐝 --- Deleting the .wasp/ directory... -------------------------------------------

✅ --- Deleted the .wasp/ directory. ----------------------------------------------

🐝 --- Deleting the node\_modules/ directory... ------------------------------------

✅ --- Deleted the node\_modules/ directory. ---------------------------------------

```

- `wasp build` generates the complete web app code, which is ready for [deployment](../deployment/intro.md). Use this command when you're deploying or ejecting. The generated code is stored in the `.wasp/build` folder.

- `wasp build start` takes the output of `wasp build` and starts a local server to preview it. You can use it to test the production build of your app locally. It accepts `--server-env` and `--client-env` options to specify the environment variables for the server and client, respectively. This is useful for testing how your app behaves in production, and to check which environment variables are required for the production build to work correctly. For comprehensive documentation and examples, see [Production Build Preview](../deployment/local-testing.md).

- `wasp deploy` makes it easy to get your app hosted on the web.

Currently, Wasp offers support for [Fly.io](https://fly.io) and [Railway](https://railway.com/?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=wasp). If you prefer a different hosting provider, you can [let us know on Discord](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX) or [contribute the code yourself](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/main/waspc/packages/deploy).

Read more about automatic deployment [here](../deployment/deployment-methods/wasp-deploy/overview.md).

- `wasp telemetry` displays the status of [telemetry](../telemetry.md).

```

$ wasp telemetry

Telemetry is currently: ENABLED
Telemetry cache directory: /home/user/.cache/wasp/telemetry/
Last time telemetry data was sent for this project: 2021-05-27 09:21:16.79537226 UTC
Our telemetry is anonymized and very limited in its scope: check https://wasp.sh/docs/telemetry for more details.

```
- `wasp deps` lists the dependencies that Wasp uses in your project.
- `wasp info` provides basic details about the current Wasp project.
- `wasp studio` shows you an graphical overview of your application in a graph: pages, queries, actions, data model etc.

#### Database Commands
Wasp provides a suite of commands for managing the database. These commands all begin with `db` and primarily execute Prisma commands behind the scenes.

- `wasp db migrate-dev` synchronizes the development database with the current state of the schema (entities). If there are any changes in the schema, it generates a new migration and applies any pending migrations to the database.
- The `--name foo` option allows you to specify a name for the migration, while the `--create-only` option lets you create an empty migration without applying it.

- `wasp db studio` opens the GUI for inspecting your database.

:::caution using `prisma` CLI directly

Although Wasp uses the `schema.prisma` file to define the database schema, you must not use the `prisma` command directly. Instead, use the `wasp db` commands.

Wasp adds some additional functionality on top of Prisma, and using `prisma` commands directly can lead to unexpected behavior e.g. missing auth models, incorrect database setup, etc.

:::

#### Bash Completion

To set up Bash completion, run the `wasp completion` command and follow the instructions.

#### Miscellaneous Commands
- `wasp version` displays the current version of the CLI.

```

$ wasp version

0.14.0

If you wish to install/switch to the latest version of Wasp, do:
curl -sSL https://get.wasp.sh/installer.sh | sh -s

If you want specific x.y.z version of Wasp, do:
curl -sSL https://get.wasp.sh/installer.sh | sh -s -- -v x.y.z

Check https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/releases for the list of valid versions, including the latest one.

```
- `wasp uninstall` removes Wasp from your system.

```

$ wasp uninstall

🐝 --- Uninstalling Wasp ... ------------------------------------------------------

We will remove the following directories:
{home}/.local/share/wasp-lang/
{home}/.cache/wasp/

We will also remove the following files:
{home}/.local/bin/wasp

Are you sure you want to continue? \[y/N]

✅ --- Uninstalled Wasp -----------------------------------------------------------

```

## TypeScript Support

## TypeScript support

TypeScript is a programming language that adds static type analysis to JavaScript.
It is a superset of JavaScript, which means all JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code.
It also compiles to JavaScript before running.

TypeScript's type system helps catch errors at build time (this reduces runtime errors), and provides type-based auto-completion in IDEs.

Each Wasp feature includes TypeScript documentation.

If you're starting a new project and want to use TypeScript, you don't need to do anything special.
Just follow the feature docs you are interested in, and they will tell you everything you need to know.
We recommend you start by going through [the tutorial](../tutorial/01-create.md).

To migrate an existing Wasp project from JavaScript to TypeScript, follow this guide.

### Migrating your project to TypeScript

Since Wasp ships with out-of-the-box TypeScript support, migrating your project is as simple as changing file extensions and using the language.
This approach allows you to gradually migrate your project on a file-by-file basis.

We will first show you how to migrate a single file and then help you generalize the procedure to the rest of your project.

#### Migrating a single file

Assuming your `schema.prisma` file defines the `Task` entity:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
// ...

model Task {
  id          Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  description String
  isDone      Boolean
}
```

And your `main.wasp` file defines the `getTaskInfo` query:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
query getTaskInfo {
  fn: import { getTaskInfo } from "@src/queries",
  entities: [Task]
}
```

We will show you how to migrate the following `queries.js` file:

```javascript title="src/queries.js"

function getInfoMessage(task) {
  const isDoneText = task.isDone ? 'is done' : 'is not done'
  return `Task '${task.description}' is ${isDoneText}.`
}

export const getTaskInfo = async ({ id }, context) => {
  const Task = context.entities.Task
  const task = await Task.findUnique({ where: { id } })
  if (!task) {
    throw new HttpError(404)
  }
  return getInfoMessage(task)
}
```

To migrate this file to TypeScript, all you have to do is:

1. Change the filename from `queries.js` to `queries.ts`.
2. Write some types (and optionally use some of Wasp's TypeScript features).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
    ```javascript title="src/queries.js"
    import HttpError from '@wasp/core/HttpError.js'

    function getInfoMessage(task) {
      const isDoneText = task.isDone ? 'is done' : 'is not done'
      return `Task '${task.description}' is ${isDoneText}.`
    }

    export const getTaskInfo = async ({ id }, context) => {
      const Task = context.entities.Task
      const task = await Task.findUnique({ where: { id } })
      if (!task) {
        throw new HttpError(404)
      }
      return getInfoMessage(task)
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="after" label="After">
    ```typescript title="src/queries.ts"
    import HttpError from 'wasp/server'
    // highlight-next-line
    import { type Task } from '@wasp/entities'
    // highlight-next-line
    import { type GetTaskInfo } from '@wasp/server/operations'

    // highlight-next-line
    function getInfoMessage(task: Pick<Task, 'isDone' | 'description'>): string {
      const isDoneText = task.isDone ? 'is done' : 'is not done'
      return `Task '${task.description}' is ${isDoneText}.`
    }

    // highlight-next-line
    export const getTaskInfo: GetTaskInfo<Pick<Task, 'id'>, string> = async (
      { id },
      context
    ) => {
      const Task = context.entities.Task

      const task = await Task.findUnique({ where: { id } })
      if (!task) {
        throw new HttpError(404)
      }

      return getInfoMessage(task)
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Your code is now processed by TypeScript and uses several of Wasp's TypeScript-specific features:

- `Task` - A type that represents the `Task` entity. Using this type connects your data to the model definitions in the `schema.prisma` file. Read more about this feature [here](../data-model/entities).
- `GetTaskInfo<...>` - A generic type Wasp automatically generates to give you type
  support when implementing the Query. Thanks to this type, the compiler knows:

  - The type of the `context` object.
  - The type of `args`.
  - The Query's return type.

  And gives you Intellisense and type-checking. Read more about this feature [here](../data-model/operations/queries#implementing-queries).

You don't need to change anything inside the `.wasp` file.

#### Migrating the rest of the project

You can migrate your project gradually - on a file-by-file basis.

When you want to migrate a file, follow the procedure outlined above:

1. Change the file's extension.
2. Fix the type errors.
3. Read the Wasp docs and decide which TypeScript features you want to use.

<TypescriptServerNote />

## Wasp TypeScript config (*.wasp.ts)

:::caution Requires Wasp >= 0.16.3
This document assumes your app works with Wasp >= 0.16.3.\
If you haven't migrated your app yet, follow the [migration instructions](../migration-guides/migrate-from-0-15-to-0-16.md) and verify everything works. After that, come back here and try out the new Wasp TS config.
:::

:::caution Early preview
This feature is currently in early preview and we are actively working on it.
:::

:::caution Running `wasp ts-setup`
Whenever you run run `wasp clean` or remove `node_modules` on  your own, you must rerun `wasp ts-setup`! We will remove this requirement in future versions. Read more about it below.
:::

In Wasp, you normally define/configure the high level of your app (pages, routes, queries, actions, auth, ...) in a `main.wasp` file in the root of your project. In `main.wasp` you write in Wasp's DSL (domain-specific language), which is a simple configuration language similar to JSON but smarter.

Wasp recently introduced the **Wasp TS config**, an alternative way to define the high level of your app via `main.wasp.ts`! Although it looks similar to how you would do it in `main.wasp`, the difference is that you write in TypeScript, not in Wasp's DSL.

Wasp TS config is an **early preview** feature, meaning it is a little rough and not yet where it could be, but it does work. We think it's pretty cool already, and you can try it out now. If you do, please share your feedback and ideas with us on our [GitHub](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp) or <DiscordLink />. This is crucial for us to be able to shape this feature in the best possible way!

### Motivation

- Out-of-the-box support in all editors.
- Less maintenance on our side.
- More flexibility for you while writing the config.
- It will enable us to easily add support for multiple Wasp files in the future.
- A great foundation for the Full Stack Modules (FSM) that are a part of our future plans.

### How to switch from the Wasp DSL config to the Wasp TS config

1. Go into the Wasp project you want to switch to the Wasp TS config (or create a new Wasp project if you want to try it out like that). Make sure you are on Wasp >= 0.16.3 and your project is working.
2. Rename `tsconfig.json` file to `tsconfig.src.json`
3. Create a new `tsconfig.json` file with the following content:

   ```json title="tsconfig.json"
   {
     "files": [],
     "references": [
       { "path": "./tsconfig.src.json" },
       { "path": "./tsconfig.wasp.json" }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. Create a new `tsconfig.wasp.json` file with the following content:

   ```json title="tsconfig.wasp.json"
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "skipLibCheck": true,
       "target": "ES2022",
       "isolatedModules": true,
       "moduleDetection": "force",

       "strict": true,
       "noUnusedLocals": true,
       "noUnusedParameters": true,

       "module": "NodeNext",
       "noEmit": true,

       "lib": ["ES2023"]
     },
     "include": ["main.wasp.ts"]
   }
   ```

5. Add `"type": "module"` to the top level of your `package.json`, if you don't have it yet:

   ```json title="package.json"
   {
     "type": "module",
     ...
   }
   ```

6. Rename the `main.wasp` file to `main.wasp.old`. You'll want to use it as a reference while writing `main.wasp.ts`.

7. Run `wasp clean` and `rm package-lock.json`. This ensures you start from a clean state.

8. Run `wasp ts-setup`. This command will add the `wasp-config` package to your `package.json`'s `devDependencies`.

   **IMPORTANT:** Every time you run `wasp clean` or delete your `node_modules`, you _must_ follow it up with `wasp ts-setup`. This is a temporary meassure until we improve the feature.

9. Create an empty `main.wasp.ts` file and rewrite your `main.wasp.old` in it but in TypeScript.

   Check out the [reference main.wasp.ts file](#reference-mainwaspts-file) below for details on what the TypeScript API for configuring Wasp looks like.
   In short, you'll have to:

   1. Import `App` from `wasp-config`
   2. Create a new `app` object with `new App()`.
   3. Use the `app` object to define parts of your web app like `auth`, `pages`, `query`, `api`...
   4. Export the `app` from your file using a default export.

   You can manually do the rewrite using the reference file and TS types as guides (IDE support should work for you in `main.wasp.ts`), or you can (and we recommend it!) give the reference main.wasp.ts file to the LLM of your choice and tell it to rewrite your `main.wasp` while following the format in the reference file: we had great results with this!

10. Run `wasp start` to run your app! If you got everything right, your app should work exactly like it did before. The only difference is that it's now reading the Wasp config from `main.wasp.ts` instead of `main.wasp`.
    :::tip
    Don't forget, during `wasp start`, to have the database running or do the db migrations if needed, as you would normally when running your app in development.
    :::

11. That is it, you are now using Wasp TS config! You can delete `main.wasp.old` file now if you still have it around.

:::caution
If you run `wasp clean` or remove `node_modules` on  your own, you will have to rerun `wasp ts-setup`! This is a temporary workaround, we will remove it in future versions.
:::

Got stuck on any of these steps? Let us know in our <DiscordLink /> and we will help!

### What next?

#### Experiment

Play with the Wasp TS config, get the feel of it, and see if you can find ways to improve it. Here are some ideas you can experiment with:

- How would you reduce the boilerplate in `main.wasp.ts` file? Helper functions, loops?
- Can you imagine a better API or better abstractions? If you can, what would that look like? Perhaps you can even implement it on top of our API?
- Give a try at implementing your own file-based routing if that is what you like: you are now in Turing complete language and have access to the disk!
- Surprise us!

#### Feedback

Whatever you end up doing, we would love it if you would let us know how it was and show us what you did.

We do have some immediate ideas of our own about what we want to improve, but we want to hear what you thought of, what you liked or disliked, or what you came up with. Even if you just found it all good, or just a single thing you didn't or did like, that is also valuable feedback and we would love to hear it!

Let us know on our [GitHub](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp) or, even better, in our <DiscordLink />.

# Migration guides

## Migration from 0.17.X to 0.18.X

### What's new in 0.18.0?

#### Wasp now requires Node.js >=22.12

We've updated our Node.js version requirement to **Node.js 22.12 or higher**, ahead of [the upcoming LTS releases in October 2025](https://github.com/nodejs/Release/blob/755d5821ca9454b91d83f51736b4dddbd7a2600c/README.md).

The jump from Node.js 20 to 22 brings significant [performance improvements](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v21-release-announce#performance), new features (like [stable `fetch`](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v21-release-announce#stable-fetchwebstreams) or [`require(esm)`](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v22.12.0#requireesm-is-now-enabled-by-default)), and overall enhanced security.

These releases are light on breaking changes and we expect the vast majority (if not all) of Wasp apps to run on the new version, unchanged.

#### Wasp now uses Vite 7

Wasp has upgraded to Vite 7 internally, which brings performance improvements and improved compatibility. You can now also use newer plugins in your Vite configuration that take advantage of Vite 7 features.

This upgrade contains no known breaking changes for Wasp apps and we expect most of them to upgrade without any code changes.

#### Wasp Tailwind Configuration Now Uses ESM

Wasp has transitioned from CommonJS (CJS) to ECMAScript Modules (ESM) for Tailwind configuration files.
This affects both the **import/export syntax** and **file extensions** (`.cjs` ➝ `.js`).

#### Wasp simplified the bash completion setup

You no longer need to generate a separate file for bash completion.
Instead, you can add bash completion directly to your shell configuration.

Additionally, we've added the missing `db` commands to bash completion.

### How to migrate?

To migrate your Wasp app from 0.17.X to 0.18.X, follow these steps:

#### 1. Install Node.js 22.12 or higher

Make sure you have Node.js 22.12 or higher installed. You can check your current version with:

```bash
node -v
```

If you followed our [Quick Start tutorial](../quick-start#requirements), you can use `nvm use 22` to upgrade your Node.js version.
If you installed Node.js some other way, you can check their [official installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for more guidance. 

#### 2. Bump the Wasp version

Update the version field in your Wasp file to `^0.18.0`:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app MyApp {
  wasp: {
    // highlight-next-line
    version: "^0.18.0"
  },
}
```

#### 3. Convert CJS Syntax to ESM

Update your `tailwind.config.cjs` file to use ESM:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="before" label="Before">

```js title="tailwind.config.cjs"
const { resolveProjectPath } = require('wasp/dev')

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [resolveProjectPath("./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}")],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/typography')],
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="after" label="After">

```js title="tailwind.config.cjs"

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [resolveProjectPath("./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}")],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [TailwindTypography],
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Same for the `postcss.config.cjs` file:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="before" label="Before">

```js title="postcss.config.cjs"
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="after" label="After">

```js title="postcss.config.cjs"
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### 4. Rename Tailwind Configuration Files

Update the Tailwind configuration files' extensions from `.cjs` to `.js`:
- `tailwind.config.cjs` ➝ `tailwind.config.js`
- `postcss.config.cjs` ➝ `postcss.config.js`

#### 5. Check your compatibility with Vite 7

Wasp now uses Vite 7 for better performance and stability. This includes some breaking changes, but we don't expect Wasp apps to be affected by them. If you are using Vite features directly in your app, you should check the migration guides for [v5](https://v5.vite.dev/guide/migration.html), [v6](https://v6.vite.dev/guide/migration.html), and [v7](https://v7.vite.dev/guide/migration.html). We expect most Wasp apps to be unaffected by these changes.

The only manual change you need to make is to update your `package.json` file:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="before" label="Before">

```json title="package.json"
{
  // ...
  "devDependencies": {
    // ...
    "vite": "^4.3.9"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="after" label="After">

```json title="package.json"
{
  // ...
  "devDependencies": {
    // ...
    "vite": "^7.0.6"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### 6. Update you Wasp bash completions (if you used them before)

Wasp simplified how bash completions work.
Instead of maintaining a separate file, you can now enable completions with a single line in your shell configuration.

To update:

1) Delete the old `wasp-completion` file.

Previously, we asked you to generate a `wasp-completion` file in a folder of your choice:
```sh
wasp completion:generate > <your-chosen-directory>/wasp-completion"
```
This file is no longer necessary and we can delete it.

2) Update your shell configuration

Before, you had to source the `wasp-completion` file, now we can just call `complete` directly:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="before" label="Before">

```bash
source <your-chosen-directory>/wasp-completion
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="after" label="After">

```bash
complete -o default -o nospace -C 'wasp completion:list' wasp
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### 7. Enjoy your updated Wasp app

That's it!

## Migration from 0.16.X to 0.17.X

### What's new in 0.17.0?

#### The `login` function parameters changed (username & password only)

:::info
This change only affects you if you're using [username and password authentication](../auth/username-and-pass.md) with
[custom auth UI](../auth/username-and-pass/create-your-own-ui.md). If you're using [email authentication](../auth/email.md),
[social authentication](../auth/social-auth/overview.md), or our premade [Auth UI](../auth/ui.md) components,
you don't need to take any action.
:::

The `login` function, as imported from `wasp/client/auth`, has changed
the way of calling it:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="before" label="Before">

```ts

await login(usernameValue, passwordValue);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="after" label="After">

```ts

await login({ username: usernameValue, password: passwordValue });
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This is to make it consistent with the `login` and `signup` calls in other
authentication methods, which were already using this convention.

#### Wasp no longer generates a default `favicon.ico`

Wasp will no longer generate `favicon.ico` if there isn't one in the `public` directory.
Also, Wasp will no longer generate a `<link>` meta tag in `index.html`. You'll need to define it yourself explicitly.

New Wasp projects come with a default `favicon.ico` in the `public` directory and the `<link>` meta tag in the `main.wasp` file.

### How to migrate?

To migrate your Wasp app from 0.16.X to 0.17.X, follow these steps:

#### 1. Bump the Wasp version

Update the version field in your Wasp file to `^0.17.0`:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app MyApp {
  wasp: {
    // highlight-next-line
    version: "^0.17.0"
  },
}
```

#### 2. Change the parameters to the `login` function (username & password only)

:::info
This change only affects you if you're using [username and password authentication](../auth/username-and-pass.md) with
[custom auth UI](../auth/username-and-pass/create-your-own-ui.md). If you're using [email authentication](../auth/email.md),
[social authentication](../auth/social-auth/overview.md), or our premade [Auth UI](../auth/ui.md) components,
you don't need to take any action.
:::

If you were using the `login` function (imported from `wasp/client/auth`),
change its parameters from `login(usernameValue, passwordValue)` to
`login({ username: usernameValue, password: passwordValue })`.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="before" label="Before">

```tsx title="src/components/MyLoginForm.tsx"

export const MyLoginForm = () => {
  const [usernameValue, setUsernameValue] = useState("");
  const [passwordValue, setPasswordValue] = useState("");

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    await login(usernameValue, passwordValue);
    // ...
  };

  return <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>{/* ... */}</form>;
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="after" label="After">

```tsx title="src/components/MyLoginForm.tsx"

export const MyLoginForm = () => {
  const [usernameValue, setUsernameValue] = useState("");
  const [passwordValue, setPasswordValue] = useState("");

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    await login({ username: usernameValue, password: passwordValue });
    // ...
  };

  return <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>{/* ... */}</form>;
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

It is possible that you were not using this function in your code.
If you're instead using [the `<LoginForm>` component](../auth/ui.md#login-form),
this change is already handled for you.

#### 3. Update your `tsconfig.json`

To ensure your project works correctly with Wasp 0.17.0, you must also update your
`tsconfig.json` file.

If you haven't changed anything in your project's `tsconfig.json` file (this is
the case for most users), just replace its contents with the new version shown
below.

If you have made changes to your `tsconfig.json` file, we recommend taking the
new version of the file and reapplying them.

Here's the new version of `tsconfig.json`:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
// =============================== IMPORTANT =================================
// This file is mainly used for Wasp IDE support.
//
// Wasp will compile your code with slightly different (less strict) compilerOptions.
// You can increase the configuration's strictness (e.g., by adding
// "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true), but you shouldn't reduce it (e.g., by
// adding "strict": false). Just keep in mind that this will only affect your
// IDE support, not the actual compilation.
//
// Full TypeScript configurability is coming very soon :)
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "esnext",
    "composite": true,
    "target": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "moduleDetection": "force",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "allowJs": true,
    "outDir": ".wasp/out/user"
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

#### 4. Update your `package.json`

Wasp now requires `typescript` to be set to version `5.8.2`.

Here’s the updated `package.json` snippet:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="before" label="Before">

```json title="package.json"
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.1.0",
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="after" label="After">

```json title="package.json"
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "5.8.2",
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### 5. Tell Wasp about `jest-dom` types

If you're using (or planning to use) Wasp's [client tests](../project/testing.md) with `jest-dom`,
update your `src/vite-env.d.ts` file:

```ts src/vite-env.d.ts {3-7}
/// <reference types="vite/client" />

// This is needed to properly support Vitest testing with jest-dom matchers.
// Types for jest-dom are not recognized automatically and Typescript complains
// about missing types e.g. when using `toBeInTheDocument` and other matchers.
// Reference: https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom/issues/546#issuecomment-1889884843

```

#### 6. Add a `favicon.ico` to the `public` directory

This step is necessary only if you don't have a `favicon.ico` in your `public` folder.
If so, you should add a `favicon.ico` to your `public` folder.

If you want to keep the default, you can [download it here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasp-lang/wasp/refs/heads/main/waspc/data/Cli/starters/skeleton/public/favicon.ico).

If you want to generate a `favicon.ico` and all its possible variants, check out [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/), a handy open-source tool for creating favicons.

#### 7. Add a `<link>` meta tag for `favicon.ico`

This step is required for all of the project's which use `favicon.ico`.
Add the `<link>` meta tag to the `head` property in the `main.wasp`

```wasp title="main.wasp
app MyApp {
  // ...
  head: [
    // highlight-next-line
    "<link rel='icon' href='/favicon.ico' />",
  ]
}
```

#### 8. Upgrade Express dependencies

If you had `express` or `@types/express` in your `package.json`, you should change them to use version 5:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="before" label="Before">

```json title="package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "~4.21.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/express": "^4.17.13"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="after" label="After">

```json title="package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "~5.1.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/express": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### 9. Upgrade your `api` endpoints to Express 5

Wasp now uses [Express v5](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html), which impacts
[API Endpoints](../advanced/apis.md) (defined with `api` in your Wasp file).
[Operations](../data-model/operations/overview.md) (defined with `query` and `action` in your Wasp file)
are not affected by this change.

To upgrade, follow [Express's v5 migration guide](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html).

:::tip
In general, you only need to worry about changes to the `req` and `res` objects in your API endpoints.
The breaking changes are mostly edge cases and most code should work without any updates.
:::

#### 10. Enjoy your updated Wasp app

That's it!

You should now be able to run your app with the new Wasp 0.17.0.

## Migration from 0.15.X to 0.16.X

### What's new in 0.16.0?

#### Env variables validation with Zod

Wasp now uses Zod to validate environment variables, allowing it to fail faster if something is misconfigured. This means you’ll get more relevant error messages when running your app with incorrect env variables.

You can also use Zod to validate your own environment variables. Here’s an example:

```ts
// src/env.ts

export const serverEnvValidationSchema = defineEnvValidationSchema(
  z.object({
    STRIPE_API_KEY: z.string({
      required_error: 'STRIPE_API_KEY is required.',
    }),
  })
)

// main.wasp
app myApp {
  ...
  server: {
    envValidationSchema: import { serverEnvValidationSchema } from "@src/env",
  },
}
```

Read more about it in the [env variables](../project/env-vars.md#custom-env-var-validations) section of the docs.

### How to migrate?

To migrate your Wasp app from 0.15.X to 0.16.X, follow these steps:

#### 1. Bump the Wasp version

Update the version field in your Wasp file to `^0.16.0`:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app MyApp {
  wasp: {
    // highlight-next-line
    version: "^0.16.0"
  },
}
```

##### 1.1 Additional step for Wasp TS Config users

If you're using [Wasp's new TS config](../general/wasp-ts-config.md), you must
also rerun the `wasp ts-setup` command in your project. This command updates
the path for the `wasp-config` package in your `package.json`.

#### 2. Update the `package.json` file

Make sure to explicitly add `react-dom` and `react-router-dom` to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // highlight-start
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.26.2"
    // highlight-end
  }
}
```

#### 3. Update the `tsconfig.json` file

Wasp now internally works with TypeScript project references, so you'll have to
update your `tsconfig.json` (Wasp will validate your `tsconfig.json` and warn
you if you forget something). Here are all the properties you must change:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "composite": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "outDir": ".wasp/out/user"
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

#### 4. Enjoy your updated Wasp app

That's it!

You should now be able to run your app with the new Wasp 0.16.0.

## Migration from 0.14.X to 0.15.X

### What's new in 0.15.0?

Wasp 0.15.0 brings upgrades to some of Wasp's most important dependencies. Let's see what's new.

#### Prisma 5

Wasp is now using the latest Prisma 5, which brings a lot of performance improvements and new features.

From the Prisma docs:

> Prisma ORM 5.0.0 introduces a number of changes, including the usage of our new JSON Protocol, which make Prisma Client faster by default.

This means that your Wasp app will be faster and more reliable with the new Prisma 5 version.

#### React Router 6

Wasp also upgraded its React Router version from `5.3.4` to `6.26.2`. This means that we are now using the latest React Router version, which brings us up to speed and opens up new possibilities for Wasp e.g. potentially using loaders and actions in the future.

There are some breaking changes in React Router 6, so you will need to update your app to use the new hooks and components.

### How to migrate?

To migrate your Wasp app from 0.14.X to 0.15.X, follow these steps:

#### 1. Bump the Wasp version

Update the version field in your Wasp file to `^0.15.0`:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app MyApp {
  wasp: {
    // highlight-next-line
    version: "^0.15.0"
  },
}
```

#### 2. Update the `package.json` file

1. Update the `prisma` version in your `package.json` file to `5.19.1`, and add `"type": "module"` to the top level:

   ```json title="package.json"
   {
     ...
      // highlight-next-line
     "type": "module",
     "devDependencies": {
       ....
       // highlight-next-line
       "prisma": "5.19.1"
     }
     ...
   }
   ```

2. If you have `@types/react-router-dom` in your `package.json`, you can remove it as it is no longer needed.

#### 3. Use the latest React Router APIs

Update the usage of the old React Router 5 APIs to the new React Router 6 APIs:

1. If you used the `useHistory()` hook, you should now use the `useNavigate()` hook.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
       ```tsx title="src/SomePage.tsx"
       import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom'

       export function SomePage() {
         const history = useHistory()
         const handleClick = () => {
           // highlight-next-line
           history.push('/new-route')
         }
         return <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to new route</button>
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>

     <TabItem value="after" label="After">
       ```tsx title="src/SomePage.tsx"
       import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'

       export function SomePage() {
         const navigate = useNavigate()
         const handleClick = () => {
           // highlight-next-line
           navigate('/new-route')
         }
         return <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to new route</button>
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   Check the [React Router 6 docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-navigate#optionsreplace) for more information on the `useNavigate()` hook.

2. If you used the `<Redirect />` component, you should now use the `<Navigate />` component.

   The default behaviour changed from `replace` to `push` in v6, so if you want to keep the old behaviour, you should add the `replace` prop.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
       ```tsx title="src/SomePage.tsx"
       import { Redirect } from 'react-router-dom'

       export function SomePage() {
         return (
           // highlight-next-line
           <Redirect to="/new-route" />
         )
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>

     <TabItem value="after" label="After">
       ```tsx title="src/SomePage.tsx"
       import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom'

         return (
           // highlight-next-line
           <Navigate to="/new-route" replace />
         )
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   Check the [React Router 6 docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/navigate) for more information on the `<Navigate />` component.

3. If you accessed the route params using `props.match.params`, you should now use the `useParams()` hook.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
       ```tsx title="src/SomePage.tsx"
       import { RouteComponentProps } from 'react-router-dom'

       export function SomePage(props: RouteComponentProps) {
         // highlight-next-line
         const { id } = props.match.params
         return (
           <div>
             <h1>Item {id}</h1>
           </div>
         )
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>

     <TabItem value="after" label="After">
       ```tsx title="src/SomePage.tsx"
       import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom'

       export function SomePage() {
         // highlight-next-line
         const { id } = useParams()
         return (
           <div>
             <h1>Item {id}</h1>
           </div>
         )
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   Check the [React Router 6 docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-params) for more information on the `useParams()` hook.

4. If you used the `<NavLink />` component and its `isActive` prop to set the active link state, you should now set the `className` prop directly.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
       ```tsx title="src/SomePage.tsx"
       import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom'

       export function SomePage() {
         return (
           <NavLink
             to="/new-route"
             // highlight-start
             isActive={(_match, location) => {
               return location.pathname === '/new-route'
             }}
             // highlight-end
             className={(isActive) =>
               cn('text-blue-500', {
                 underline: isActive,
               })
             }
           >
             Go to new route
           </NavLink>
         )
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>

     <TabItem value="after" label="After">
       ```tsx title="src/SomePage.tsx"
       import { NavLink, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom'

       export function SomePage() {
         // highlight-next-line
         const location = useLocation()
         return (
           <NavLink
             to="/new-route"
             className={() =>
               cn('text-blue-500', {
                 // highlight-next-line
                 underline: location.pathname === '/new-route',
               })
             }
           >
             Go to new route
           </NavLink>
         )
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   Check the [React Router 6 docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/nav-link#navlink) for more information on the `<NavLink />` component.

#### 4. Update your root component

The `client.rootComponent` now requires rendering `<Outlet />` instead the `children` prop.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app MyApp {
      title: "My app",
      // ...
      client: {
        rootComponent: import { App } from "@src/App.tsx",
      }
    }
    ```

    ```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
    export function App({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
      return (
        <div>
          <header>
            <h1>My App</h1>
          </header>
          // highlight-next-line
          {children}
          <footer>
            <p>My App footer</p>
          </footer>
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="after" label="After">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app MyApp {
      title: "My app",
      // ...
      client: {
        rootComponent: import { App } from "@src/App.tsx",
      }
    }
    ```

    ```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
    import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom'

    export function App() {
      return (
        <div>
          <header>
            <h1>My App</h1>
          </header>
          // highlight-next-line
          <Outlet />
          <footer>
            <p>My App footer</p>
          </footer>
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

That's it!

You should now be able to run your app with the new Wasp 0.15.0.

## Migration from 0.13.X to 0.14.X

:::note Are you on 0.11.X or earlier?

This guide only covers the migration from **0.13.X to 0.14.X**. If you are migrating from 0.11.X or earlier, please read the [migration guide from 0.11.X to 0.12.X](./migrate-from-0-11-to-0-12.md) first.

:::

### What's new in 0.14.0?

#### Using Prisma Schema file directly

Before 0.14.0, users defined their entities in the `.wasp` file, and Wasp generated the `schema.prisma` file based on that. This approach had some limitations, and users couldn't use some advanced Prisma features.

Wasp now exposes the `schema.prisma` file directly to the user. You now define your entities in the `schema.prisma` file and Wasp uses that to generate the database schema and Prisma client. You can use all the Prisma features directly in the `schema.prisma` file. Simply put, the `schema.prisma` file is now the source of truth for your database schema.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app myApp {
      wasp: {
        version: "^0.13.0"
      },
      title: "MyApp",
      db: {
        system: PostgreSQL
      },
    }

    entity User {=psl
      id       Int @id @default(autoincrement())
      tasks    Task[]
    psl=}

    entity Task {=psl
      id          Int @id @default(autoincrement())
      description String
      isDone      Boolean
      userId      Int
      user        User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
    psl=}
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="after" label="After">
    ```wasp title="main.wasp"
    app myApp {
      wasp: {
        version: "^0.14.0"
      },
      title: "MyApp",
    }
    ```

    ```prisma title="schema.prisma"
    datasource db {
      provider = "postgresql"
      url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }

    generator client {
      provider = "prisma-client-js"
    }

    model User {
      id       Int @id @default(autoincrement())
      tasks    Task[]
    }

    model Task {
      id          Int @id @default(autoincrement())
      description String
      isDone      Boolean
      userId      Int
      user        User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Better auth user API

Wasp introduced a much simpler API for accessing user auth fields like `username`, `email` or `isEmailVerified` on the `user` object. You don't need to use helper functions every time you want to access the user's `username` or do extra steps to get proper typing.

### How to migrate?

To migrate your app to Wasp 0.14.x, you must:

1. Bump the version in `main.wasp` and update your `tsconfig.json`.
2. Migrate your entities into the new `schema.prisma` file.
3. Update code that accesses user fields.

#### Bump the version and update `tsconfig.json`

Let's start with something simple. Update the version field in your Wasp file to `^0.14.0`:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app MyApp {
  wasp: {
    // highlight-next-line
    version: "^0.14.0"
  },
}
```

To ensure your project works correctly with Wasp 0.14.0, you must also update your
`tsconfig.json` file.

If you haven't changed anything in your project's `tsconfig.json` file (this is
the case for most users), just replace its contents with the new version shown
below.

If you have made changes to your `tsconfig.json` file, we recommend taking the
new version of the file and reapplying them.

Here's the new version of the `tsconfig.json` file:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
// =============================== IMPORTANT =================================
//
// This file is only used for Wasp IDE support. You can change it to configure
// your IDE checks, but none of these options will affect the TypeScript
// compiler. Proper TS compiler configuration in Wasp is coming soon :)
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "esnext",
    "target": "esnext",
    // We're bundling all code in the end so this is the most appropriate option,
    // it's also important for autocomplete to work properly.
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    // JSX support
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "strict": true,
    // Allow default imports.
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "typeRoots": [
      // This is needed to properly support Vitest testing with jest-dom matchers.
      // Types for jest-dom are not recognized automatically and Typescript complains
      // about missing types e.g. when using `toBeInTheDocument` and other matchers.
      "node_modules/@testing-library",
      // Specifying type roots overrides the default behavior of looking at the
      // node_modules/@types folder so we had to list it explicitly.
      // Source 1: https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#typeRoots
      // Source 2: https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom/issues/546#issuecomment-1889884843
      "node_modules/@types"
    ],
    // Since this TS config is used only for IDE support and not for
    // compilation, the following directory doesn't exist. We need to specify
    // it to prevent this error:
    // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42609768/typescript-error-cannot-write-file-because-it-would-overwrite-input-file
    "outDir": ".wasp/phantom"
  }
}
```

#### Migrate to the new `schema.prisma` file

To use the new `schema.prisma` file, you need to move your entities from the `.wasp` file to the `schema.prisma` file.

1\. **Create a new `schema.prisma` file**

Create a new file named `schema.prisma` in the root of your project:

```c
.
├── main.wasp
...
// highlight-next-line
├── schema.prisma
├── src
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

2\. **Add the `datasource` block** to the `schema.prisma` file

This block specifies the database type and connection URL:

<Tabs groupId="db">
  <TabItem value="sqlite" label="Sqlite">
    ```prisma title="schema.prisma"
    datasource db {
      provider = "sqlite"
      url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="postgresql" label="PostgreSQL">
    ```prisma title="schema.prisma"
    datasource db {
      provider = "postgresql"
      url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

- The `provider` should be either `"postgresql"` or `"sqlite"`.

- The `url` must be set to `env("DATABASE_URL")` so that Wasp can inject the database URL from the environment variables.

3\. **Add the `generator` block** to the `schema.prisma` file

This block specifies the Prisma Client generator Wasp uses:

<Tabs groupId="db">
  <TabItem value="sqlite" label="Sqlite">
    ```prisma title="schema.prisma"
    datasource db {
      provider = "sqlite"
      url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }

    // highlight-start
    generator client {
      provider = "prisma-client-js"
    }
    // highlight-end
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="postgresql" label="PostgreSQL">
    ```prisma title="schema.prisma"
    datasource db {
      provider = "postgresql"
      url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }

    // highlight-start
    generator client {
      provider = "prisma-client-js"
    }
    // highlight-end
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

- The `provider` should be set to `"prisma-client-js"`.

4\. **Move your entities** to the `schema.prisma` file

Move the entities from the `.wasp` file to the `schema.prisma` file:

<Tabs groupId="db">
  <TabItem value="sqlite" label="Sqlite">
    ```prisma title="schema.prisma"
    datasource db {
      provider = "sqlite"
      url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }

    generator client {
      provider = "prisma-client-js"
    }

    // There are some example entities, you should move your entities here
    // highlight-start
    model User {
      id       Int @id @default(autoincrement())
      tasks    Task[]
    }

    model Task {
      id          Int @id @default(autoincrement())
      description String
      isDone      Boolean
      userId      Int
      user        User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
    }
    // highlight-end
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="postgresql" label="PostgreSQL">
    ```prisma title="schema.prisma"
    datasource db {
      provider = "postgresql"
      url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }

    generator client {
      provider = "prisma-client-js"
    }

    // There are some example entities, you should move your entities here
    // highlight-start
    model User {
      id       Int @id @default(autoincrement())
      tasks    Task[]
    }

    model Task {
      id          Int @id @default(autoincrement())
      description String
      isDone      Boolean
      userId      Int
      user        User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
    }
    // highlight-end
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When moving the entities over, you'll need to change `entity` to `model` and remove the `=psl` and `psl=` tags.

If you had the following in the `.wasp` file:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
entity Task {=psl
  // Stays the same
psl=}
```

... it would look like this in the `schema.prisma` file:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
model Task {
  // Stays the same
}
```

5\. **Remove `app.db.system`** field from the Wasp file

We now configure the DB system in the `schema.prisma` file, so there is no need for that field in the Wasp file.

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app MyApp {
  // ...
  db: {
    // highlight-next-line
    system: PostgreSQL,
  }
}
```

6\. **Migrate Prisma preview features config** to the `schema.prisma` file

If you didn't use any Prisma preview features, you can skip this step.

If you had the following in the `.wasp` file:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app MyApp {
  // ...
  db: {
    // highlight-start
    prisma: {
      clientPreviewFeatures: ["postgresqlExtensions"]
      dbExtensions: [
        { name: "hstore", schema: "myHstoreSchema" },
        { name: "pg_trgm" },
        { name: "postgis", version: "2.1" },
      ]
    }
    // highlight-end
  }
}
```

... it will become this:

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  // highlight-next-line
  extensions = [hstore(schema: "myHstoreSchema"), pg_trgm, postgis(version: "2.1")]
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  // highlight-next-line
  previewFeatures = ["postgresqlExtensions"]
}
```

All that's left to do is migrate the database.

To avoid type errors, it's best to take care of database migrations after you've migrated the rest of the code.
So, just keep reading, and we will remind you to migrate the database as [the last step of the migration guide](#migrate-the-database).

Read more about the [Prisma Schema File](../data-model/prisma-file.md) and how Wasp uses it to generate the database schema and Prisma client.

#### Migrate how you access user auth fields

We had to make a couple of breaking changes to reach the new simpler API.

Follow the steps below to migrate:

1. **Replace the `getUsername` helper** with `user.identities.username.id`

   If you didn't use the `getUsername` helper in your code, you can skip this step.

   This helper changed and it no longer works with the `user` you receive as a prop on a page or through the `context`. You'll need to replace it with `user.identities.username.id`.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
       ```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx"
       import { getUsername, AuthUser } from 'wasp/auth'

       const MainPage = ({ user }: { user: AuthUser }) => {
         const username = getUsername(user)
         // ...
       }
       ```

       ```ts title="src/tasks.ts"
       import { getUsername } from 'wasp/auth'

       export const createTask: CreateTask<...>  = async (args, context) => {
           const username = getUsername(context.user)
           // ...
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>

     <TabItem value="after" label="After">
       ```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx"
       import { AuthUser } from 'wasp/auth'

       const MainPage = ({ user }: { user: AuthUser }) => {
         const username = user.identities.username?.id
         // ...
       }
       ```

       ```ts title="src/tasks.ts"
       export const createTask: CreateTask<...>  = async (args, context) => {
           const username = context.user.identities.username?.id
           // ...
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. **Replace the `getEmail` helper** with `user.identities.email.id`

   If you didn't use the `getEmail` helper in your code, you can skip this step.

   This helper changed and it no longer works with the `user` you receive as a prop on a page or through the `context`. You'll need to replace it with `user.identities.email.id`.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
       ```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx"
       import { getEmail, AuthUser } from 'wasp/auth'

       const MainPage = ({ user }: { user: AuthUser }) => {
         const email = getEmail(user)
         // ...
       }
       ```

       ```ts title="src/tasks.ts"
       import { getEmail } from 'wasp/auth'

       export const createTask: CreateTask<...>  = async (args, context) => {
           const email = getEmail(context.user)
           // ...
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>

     <TabItem value="after" label="After">
       ```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx"
       import { AuthUser } from 'wasp/auth'

       const MainPage = ({ user }: { user: AuthUser }) => {
         const email = user.identities.email?.id
         // ...
       }
       ```

       ```ts title="src/tasks.ts"
       export const createTask: CreateTask<...>  = async (args, context) => {
           const email = context.user.identities.email?.id
           // ...
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

3. **Replace accessing `providerData`** with `user.identities.<provider>.<value>`

   If you didn't use any data from the `providerData` object, you can skip this step.

   Replace `<provider>` with the provider name (for example `username`, `email`, `google`, `github`, etc.) and `<value>` with the field you want to access (for example `isEmailVerified`).

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
       ```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx"
       import { findUserIdentity, AuthUser } from 'wasp/auth'

       function getProviderData(user: AuthUser) {
         const emailIdentity = findUserIdentity(user, 'email')
         // We needed this before check for proper type support
         return emailIdentity && 'isEmailVerified' in emailIdentity.providerData
           ? emailIdentity.providerData
           : null
       }

       const MainPage = ({ user }: { user: AuthUser }) => {
         const providerData = getProviderData(user)
         const isEmailVerified = providerData ? providerData.isEmailVerified : null
         // ...
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>

     <TabItem value="after" label="After">
       ```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx"
       import { AuthUser } from 'wasp/auth'

       const MainPage = ({ user }: { user: AuthUser }) => {
         // The email object is properly typed, so we can access `isEmailVerified` directly
         const isEmailVerified = user.identities.email?.isEmailVerified
         // ...
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

4. **Use `getFirstProviderUserId` directly** on the user object

   If you didn't use `getFirstProviderUserId` in your code, you can skip this step.

   You should replace `getFirstProviderUserId(user)` with `user.getFirstProviderUserId()`.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
       ```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx"
       import { getFirstProviderUserId, AuthUser } from 'wasp/auth'

       const MainPage = ({ user }: { user: AuthUser }) => {
         const userId = getFirstProviderUserId(user)
         // ...
       }
       ```

       ```ts title="src/tasks.ts"
       import { getFirstProviderUserId } from 'wasp/auth'

       export const createTask: CreateTask<...>  = async (args, context) => {
           const userId = getFirstProviderUserId(context.user)
           // ...
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>

     <TabItem value="after" label="After">
       ```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx"
       import { AuthUser } from 'wasp/auth'

       const MainPage = ({ user }: { user: AuthUser }) => {
         const userId = user.getFirstProviderUserId()
         // ...
       }
       ```

       ```ts title="src/tasks.ts"
       export const createTask: CreateTask<...>  = async (args, context) => {
           const userId = user.getFirstProviderUserId()
           // ...
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

5. **Replace `findUserIdentity`** with checks on `user.identities.<provider>`

   If you didn't use `findUserIdentity` in your code, you can skip this step.

   Instead of using `findUserIdentity` to get the identity object, you can directly check if the identity exists on the `identities` object.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
       ```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx"
       import { findUserIdentity, AuthUser } from 'wasp/auth'

       const MainPage = ({ user }: { user: AuthUser }) => {
         const usernameIdentity = findUserIdentity(user, 'username')
         if (usernameIdentity) {
           // ...
         }
       }
       ```

       ```ts title="src/tasks.ts"
       import { findUserIdentity } from 'wasp/auth'

       export const createTask: CreateTask<...>  = async (args, context) => {
           const usernameIdentity = findUserIdentity(context.user, 'username')
           if (usernameIdentity) {
               // ...
           }
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>

     <TabItem value="after" label="After">
       ```tsx title="src/MainPage.tsx"
       import { AuthUser } from 'wasp/auth'

       const MainPage = ({ user }: { user: AuthUser }) => {
         if (user.identities.username) {
           // ...
         }
       }
       ```

       ```ts title="src/tasks.ts"
       export const createTask: CreateTask<...>  = async (args, context) => {
           if (context.user.identities.username) {
               // ...
           }
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

#### Migrate the database

Finally, you can **Run the Wasp CLI** to regenerate the new Prisma client:

```bash
wasp db migrate-dev
```

This command generates the Prisma client based on the `schema.prisma` file.

Read more about the [Prisma Schema File](../data-model/prisma-file.md) and how Wasp uses it to generate the database schema and Prisma client.

That's it!

You should now be able to run your app with the new Wasp 0.14.0. We recommend reading through the updated [Accessing User Data](../auth/entities/entities.md) section to get a better understanding of the new API.

## Migration from 0.12.X to 0.13.X

:::note Are you on 0.11.X or earlier?

This guide only covers the migration from **0.12.X to 0.13.X**. If you are migrating from 0.11.X or earlier, please read the [migration guide from 0.11.X to 0.12.X](./migrate-from-0-11-to-0-12.md) first.

Make sure to read the [migration guide from 0.13.X to 0.14.X](./migrate-from-0-13-to-0-14.md) after you finish this one.

### What's new in 0.13.0?

#### OAuth providers got an overhaul

Wasp 0.13.0 switches away from using Passport for our OAuth providers in favor of [Arctic](https://arctic.js.org/) from the [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/) ecosystem. This change simplifies the codebase and makes it easier to add new OAuth providers in the future.

#### We added Keycloak as an OAuth provider

Wasp now supports using [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) as an OAuth provider.

### How to migrate?

#### Migrate your OAuth setup

We had to make some breaking changes to upgrade the OAuth setup to the new Arctic lib.

Follow the steps below to migrate:

1. **Define the `WASP_SERVER_URL` server env variable**

   In 0.13.0 Wasp introduces a new server env variable `WASP_SERVER_URL` that you need to define. This is the URL of your Wasp server and it's used to generate the redirect URL for the OAuth providers.

   ```bash title="Server env variables"
   WASP_SERVER_URL=https://your-wasp-server-url.com
   ```

   In development, Wasp sets the `WASP_SERVER_URL` to `http://localhost:3001` by default.

   :::info Migrating a deployed app

   If you are migrating a deployed app, you will need to define the `WASP_SERVER_URL` server env variable in your deployment environment.

   Read more about setting env variables in production [here](../project/env-vars#defining-env-vars-in-production).
   :::

2. **Update the redirect URLs** for the OAuth providers

   The redirect URL for the OAuth providers has changed. You will need to update the redirect URL for the OAuth providers in the provider's dashboard.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
       ```
       {clientUrl}/auth/login/{provider}
       ```
     </TabItem>

     <TabItem value="after" label="After">
       ```
       {serverUrl}/auth/{provider}/callback
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   Check the new redirect URLs for [Google](../auth/social-auth/google.md#3-creating-a-google-oauth-app) and [GitHub](../auth/social-auth/github.md#3-creating-a-github-oauth-app) in Wasp's docs.

3. **Update the `configFn`** for the OAuth providers

   If you didn't use the `configFn` option, you can skip this step.

   If you used the `configFn` to configure the `scope` for the OAuth providers, you will need to rename the `scope` property to `scopes`.

   Also, the object returned from `configFn` no longer needs to include the Client ID and the Client Secret. You can remove them from the object that `configFn` returns.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
       ```ts title="google.ts"
       export function getConfig() {
           return {
               clientID: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
               clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
               scope: ['profile', 'email'],
           }
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>

     <TabItem value="after" label="After">
       ```ts title="google.ts"
       export function getConfig() {
           return {
               scopes: ['profile', 'email'],
           }
       }
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

4. **Update the `userSignupFields` fields** to use the new `profile` format

   If you didn't use the `userSignupFields` option, you can skip this step.

   The data format for the `profile` that you receive from the OAuth providers has changed. You will need to update your code to reflect this change.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
       ```ts title="google.ts"
       import { defineUserSignupFields } from 'wasp/server/auth'

       export const userSignupFields = defineUserSignupFields({
           displayName: (data: any) => data.profile.displayName,
       })
       ```
     </TabItem>

     <TabItem value="after" label="After">
       ```ts title="google.ts"
       import { defineUserSignupFields } from 'wasp/server/auth'

       export const userSignupFields = defineUserSignupFields({
           displayName: (data: any) => data.profile.name,
       })
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   Wasp now directly forwards what it receives from the OAuth providers. You can check the data format for [Google](../auth/social-auth/google.md#data-received-from-google) and [GitHub](../auth/social-auth/github.md#data-received-from-github) in Wasp's docs.

That's it!

You should now be able to run your app with the new Wasp 0.13.0.

## Migration from 0.11.X to 0.12.X

:::note Migrating to the latest version

To fully migrate from 0.11.X to the latest version of Wasp, you should first migrate to **0.12.X** and then continue going through the migration guides.

Make sure to read the [migration guide from 0.12.X to 0.13.X](./migrate-from-0-12-to-0-13.md) after you finish this one.

:::

### What's new in Wasp 0.12.0?

#### New project structure

Here's a file tree of a fresh Wasp project created with the previous version of Wasp.
More precisely, this is what you'll get if you run `wasp new myProject` using Wasp 0.11.x:

```
.
├── .gitignore
├── main.wasp
├── src
│   ├── client
│   │   ├── Main.css
│   │   ├── MainPage.jsx
│   │   ├── react-app-env.d.ts
│   │   ├── tsconfig.json
│   │   └── waspLogo.png
│   ├── server
│   │   └── tsconfig.json
│   ├── shared
│   │   └── tsconfig.json
│   └── .waspignore
└── .wasproot
```

Compare that with the file tree of a fresh Wasp project created with Wasp
0.12.0. In other words, this is what you will get by running `wasp new myProject`
from this point onwards:

```
.
├── .gitignore
├── main.wasp
├── package.json
├── public
│   └── .gitkeep
├── src
│   ├── Main.css
│   ├── MainPage.jsx
│   ├── queries.ts
│   ├── vite-env.d.ts
│   ├── .waspignore
│   └── waspLogo.png
├── tsconfig.json
├── vite.config.ts
└── .wasproot

```

The main differences are:

- The server/client code separation is no longer necessary. You can now organize
  your code however you want, as long as it's inside the `src` directory.
- All external imports in your Wasp file must have paths starting with `@src` (e.g., `import foo from '@src/bar.js'`)
  where `@src` refers to the `src` directory in your project root. The paths can
  no longer start with `@server` or `@client`.
- Your project now features a top-level `public` dir. Wasp will publicly serve
  all the files it finds in this directory. Read more about it
  [here](../project/static-assets.md).

Our [Overview docs](../tutorial/02-project-structure.md) explain the new
structure in detail, while this page provides a [quick guide](#migrating-your-project-to-the-new-structure) for migrating existing
projects.

#### New auth

In Wasp 0.11.X, authentication was based on the `User` model which the developer needed to set up properly and take care of the auth fields like `email` or `password`.

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "^0.11.0"
  },
  title: "My App",
  auth: {
    userEntity: User,
    externalAuthEntity: SocialLogin,
    methods: {
      gitHub: {}
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  },
}

entity User {=psl
  id                        Int           @id @default(autoincrement())
  // highlight-start
  username                  String        @unique
  password                  String
  externalAuthAssociations  SocialLogin[]
  // highlight-end
psl=}

// highlight-start
entity SocialLogin {=psl
  id          Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  provider    String
  providerId  String
  user        User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  userId      Int
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  @@unique([provider, providerId, userId])
psl=}
// highlight-end
```

From 0.12.X onwards, authentication is based on the auth models which are automatically set up by Wasp. You don't need to take care of the auth fields anymore.

The `User` model is now just a business logic model and you use it for storing the data that is relevant for your app.

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "^0.12.0"
  },
  title: "My App",
  auth: {
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      gitHub: {}
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  },
}

entity User {=psl
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
psl=}
```

:::caution Regression Note: Multiple Auth Identities per User

With our old auth implementation, if you were using both Google and email auth methods, your users could sign up with Google first and then, later on, reset their password and therefore also enable logging in with their email and password. This was the only way in which a single user could have multiple login methods at the same time (Google and email).

This is not possible anymore. **The new auth system doesn't support multiple login methods per user at the moment**. We do plan to add this soon though, with the introduction of the [account merging feature](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/954).

If you have any users that have both Google and email login credentials at the same time, you will have to pick only one of those for that user to keep when migrating them.

:::

:::caution Regression Note: `_waspCustomValidations` is deprecated

Auth field customization is no longer possible using the `_waspCustomValidations` on the `User` entity. This is a part of auth refactoring that we are doing to make it easier to customize auth. We will be adding more customization options in the future.

:::

You can read more about the new auth system in the [Accessing User Data](../auth/entities) section.

### How to Migrate?

These instructions are for migrating your app from Wasp `0.11.X` to Wasp `0.12.X`, meaning they will work for all minor releases that fit this pattern (e.g., the guide applies to `0.12.0`, `0.12.1`, ...).

The guide consists of two big steps:

1. Migrating your Wasp project to the new structure.
2. Migrating to the new auth.

If you get stuck at any point, don't hesitate to ask for help on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX).

#### Migrating Your Project to the New Structure

You can easily migrate your old Wasp project to the new structure by following a
series of steps. Assuming you have a project called `foo` inside the
directory `foo`, you should:

0. **Install the `0.12.x` version** of Wasp.

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.wasp.sh/installer.sh | sh -s -- -v 0.12.4
```

1. Make sure to **backup or save your project** before starting the procedure (e.g.,
   by committing it to source control or creating a copy).
2. **Position yourself in the terminal** in the directory that is a parent of your wasp project directory (so one level above: if you do `ls`, you should see your wasp project dir listed).
3. **Run the migration script** (replace `foo` at the end with the name of your Wasp project directory) and follow the instructions:

```
npx wasp-migrate foo
```

<details>
  <summary>
    In case the migration script doesn't work well for you, you can do the same steps manually, as described here:
  </summary>

  <div>
    1. Rename your project's root directory to something like `foo_old`.

    2. Create a new project by running `wasp new foo`.

    3. Delete all files of `foo/src` except `vite-env.d.ts`.

    4. If `foo_old/src/client/public` exists and contains any files, copy those files into
       `foo/public`.

    5. Copy the contents of `foo_old/src` into `foo/src`.
       `foo/src` should now contain `vite-env.d.ts`, `.waspignore`, and three subdirectories (`server`, `client`, and `shared`).
       Don't change anything about this structure yet.

    6. Delete redundant files and folders from `foo/src`:
       - `foo/src/.waspignore` - A new version of this file already exists at the top level.
       - `foo/src/client/vite-env.d.ts` - A new version of this file already exists at the top level.
       - `foo/src/client/tsconfig.json` - A new version of this file already exists at the top level.
       - `foo/src/server/tsconfig.json` - A new version of this file already exists at the top level.
       - `foo/src/shared/tsconfig.json` - A new version of this file already exists at the top level.
       - `foo/src/client/public` - You've moved all the files from this directory in step 5.

    7. Update all the `@wasp` imports in your JS(X)/TS(X) source files in the `src/` dir.

       For this, we prepared a special script that will rewrite these imports automatically for you.

       Before doing this step, as the script will modify your JS(X)/TS(X) files in place, we advise committing
       all changes you have so far, so you can then both easily inspect the import rewrites that our
       script did (with `git diff`) and also revert them if something went wrong.

       To run the import-rewriting script, make sure you are in the root dir of your wasp project, and then run

       ```
       npx jscodeshift@0.15.1 -t https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasp-lang/wasp-codemod/main/src/transforms/imports-from-0-11-to-0-12.ts --extensions=js,ts,jsx,tsx src/
       ```

       Then, check the changes it did, in case some kind of manual intervention is needed (in which case you should see TODO comments generated by the script).

       Alternatively, you can find all the mappings of old imports to the new ones in [this table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QW-_16KRGTOaKXx9NYUtjk6m2TQ0nUMOA74hBthTH3g/edit#gid=1725669920) and use it to fix some/all of them manually.

    8. Replace the Wasp file in `foo` (i.e., `main.wasp`) with the Wasp file from `foo_old`

    9. Change the Wasp version field in your Wasp file (now residing in `foo`) to `"^0.12.0"`.

    10. Correct external imports in your Wasp file (now residing in `foo`).
        imports. You can do this by running search-and-replace inside the file:

        - Change all occurrences of `@server` to `@src/server`
        - Change all occurrences of `@client` to `@src/client`

        For example, if you previously had something like:

        ```js
        page LoginPage {
          // highlight-next-line
          // This previously resolved to src/client/LoginPage.js
          // highlight-next-line
          component: import Login from "@client/LoginPage"
        }

        // ...

        query getTasks {
          // highlight-next-line
          // This previously resolved to src/server/queries.js
          // highlight-next-line
          fn: import { getTasks } from "@server/queries.js",
        }
        ```

        You should change it to:

        ```js
        page LoginPage {
          // highlight-next-line
          // This now resolves to src/client/LoginPage.js
          // highlight-next-line
          component: import Login from "@src/client/LoginPage"
        }

        // ...

        query getTasks {
          // highlight-next-line
          // This now resolves to src/server/queries.js
          // highlight-next-line
          fn: import { getTasks } from "@src/server/queries.js",
        }
        ```

        Do this for all external imports in your `.wasp` file. After you're done, there shouldn't be any occurrences of strings `"@server"` or `"@client"`

    11. Take all the dependencies from `app.dependencies` declaration in
        `foo/main.wasp` and move them to `foo/package.json`. Make sure to remove the `app.dependencies` field from `foo/main.wasp`.

        For example, if `foo_old/main.wasp` had:

        ```css
        app Foo {
          // ...
          dependencies: [ ('redux', '^4.0.5'), ('reacjt-redux', '^7.1.3')];
        }
        ```

        Your `package.json` in `foo` should now list these dependencies (Wasp already generated most of the file, you just have to list additional dependencies).

        ```json
        {
          "name": "foo",
          "dependencies": {
            "wasp": "file:.wasp/out/sdk/wasp",
            "react": "^18.2.0",
            // highlight-next-line
            "redux": "^4.0.5",
            // highlight-next-line
            "reactjs-redux": "^7.1.3"
          },
          "devDependencies": {
            "typescript": "^5.1.0",
            "vite": "^4.3.9",
            "@types/react": "^18.0.37",
            "prisma": "4.16.2"
          }
        }
        ```

    12. Copy all lines you might have added to `foo_old/.gitignore` into
        `foo/.gitignore`

    13. Copy the rest of the top-level files and folders (all of them except for `.gitignore`, `main.wasp` and `src/`)
        in `foo_old/` into `foo/` (overwrite the existing files in `foo`).

    14. Run `wasp clean` in `foo`.

    15. Delete the `foo_old` directory.
  </div>
</details>

That's it! You now have a properly structured Wasp 0.12.0 project in the `foo` directory.
Your app probably doesn't quite work yet due to some other changes in Wasp 0.12.0, but we'll get to that in the next sections.

#### Migrating declaration names

Wasp 0.12.0 adds a casing constraints when naming Queries, Actions, Jobs, and Entities in the `main.wasp` file.

The following casing conventions have now become mandatory:

- Operation (i.e., Query and Action) names must begin with a lowercase letter: `query getTasks {...}`, `action createTask {...}`.
- Job names must begin with a lowercase letter: `job sendReport {...}`.
- Entity names must start with an uppercase letter: `entity Task {...}`.

#### Migrating the Tailwind Setup

:::note
If you don't use Tailwind in your project, you can skip this section.
:::

There is a small change in how the `tailwind.config.cjs` needs to be defined in Wasp 0.12.0.

You'll need to wrap all your paths in the `content` field with the `resolveProjectPath` function. This makes sure that the paths are resolved correctly when generating your CSS.

Here's how you can do it:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
    ```js title="tailwind.config.cjs"
    /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
    module.exports = {
      content: [
        // highlight-next-line
        './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
      ],
      theme: {
        extend: {},
      },
      plugins: [],
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="after" label="After">
    ```js title="tailwind.config.cjs"
    // highlight-next-line
    const { resolveProjectPath } = require('wasp/dev')

    /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
    module.exports = {
      content: [
        // highlight-next-line
        resolveProjectPath('./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'),
      ],
      theme: {
        extend: {},
      },
      plugins: [],
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Default Server Dockerfile Changed

:::note
If you didn't customize your Dockerfile or had a custom build process for the Wasp server, you can skip this section.
:::

Between Wasp 0.11.X and 0.12.X, the Dockerfile that Wasp generates for you for deploying the server has changed. If you defined a custom Dockerfile in your project root dir or in any other way relied on its contents, you'll need to update it to incorporate the changes that Wasp 0.12.X made.

We suggest that you temporarily move your custom Dockerfile to a different location, then run `wasp start` to generate the new Dockerfile.
Check out the `.wasp/out/Dockerfile` to see the new Dockerfile and what changes you need to make. You'll probably need to copy some of the changes from the new Dockerfile to your custom one to make your app work with Wasp 0.12.X.

#### Migrating to the New Auth

As shown in [the previous section](#new-auth), Wasp significantly changed how authentication works in version 0.12.0.
This section leads you through migrating your app from Wasp 0.11.X to Wasp 0.12.X.

Migrating your existing app to the new auth system is a two-step process:

1. Migrate to the new auth system
2. Clean up the old auth system

:::info Migrating a deployed app

While going through these steps, we will focus first on doing the changes locally (including your local development database).

Once we confirm everything works well locally, we will apply the same changes to the deployed app (including your production database).

**We'll put extra info for migrating a deployed app in a box like this one.**
:::

##### 1. Migrate to the New Auth System

You can follow these steps to migrate to the new auth system (assuming you already migrated the project structure to 0.12, as described [above](#migrating-your-project-to-the-new-structure)):

1. **Migrate `getUserFields` and/or `additionalSignupFields` in the `main.wasp` file to the new `userSignupFields` field.**

If you are not using them, you can skip this step.

In Wasp 0.11.X, you could define a `getUserFieldsFn` to specify extra fields that would get saved to the `User` when using Google or GitHub to sign up.

You could also define `additionalSignupFields` to specify extra fields for the Email or Username & Password signup.

In 0.12.X, we unified these two concepts into the `userSignupFields` field.

<details>
  <summary>Migration for <EmailPill /> and <UsernameAndPasswordPill /></summary>

  First, move the value of `auth.signup.additionalFields` to `auth.methods.{method}.userSignupFields` in the `main.wasp` file.

  `{method}` depends on the auth method you are using. For example, if you are using the email auth method, you should move the `auth.signup.additionalFields` to `auth.methods.email.userSignupFields`.

  To finish, update the JS/TS implementation to use the `defineUserSignupFields` from `wasp/server/auth` instead of `defineAdditionalSignupFields` from `@wasp/auth/index.js`.

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="before" label="Before">

          const address = data.address;
          if (typeof address !== 'string') {
            throw new Error('Address is required');

  <summary>Migration for <GithubPill /> and <GooglePill /></summary>

  First, move the value of `auth.methods.{method}.getUserFieldsFn` to `auth.methods.{method}.userSignupFields` in the `main.wasp` file.

  `{method}` depends on the auth method you are using. For example, if you are using Google auth, you should move the `auth.methods.google.getUserFieldsFn` to `auth.methods.google.userSignupFields`.

  To finish, update the JS/TS implementation to use the `defineUserSignupFields` from `wasp/server/auth` and modify the code to return the fields in the format that `defineUserSignupFields` expects.

    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
</details>

1. **Remove the `auth.methods.email.allowUnverifiedLogin` field** from your `main.wasp` file.

In Wasp 0.12.X we removed the `auth.methods.email.allowUnverifiedLogin` field to make our Email auth implementation easier to reason about. If you were using it, you should remove it from your `main.wasp` file.

1. Ensure your **local development database is running**.
2. **Do the schema migration** (create the new auth tables in the database) by running:
   ```bash
   wasp db migrate-dev
   ```

You should see the new `Auth`, `AuthIdentity` and `Session` tables in your database. You can use the `wasp db studio` command to open the database in a GUI and verify the tables are there. At the moment, they will be empty.

1. **Do the data migration** (move existing users from the old auth system to the new one by filling the new auth tables in the database with their data):

   1. **Implement your data migration function(s)** in e.g. `src/migrateToNewAuth.ts`.

      Below we prepared [examples of migration functions](#example-data-migration-functions) for each of the auth methods, for you to use as a starting point.
      They should be fine to use as-is, meaning you can just copy them and they are likely to work out of the box for typical use cases, but you can also modify them for your needs.

      We recommend you create one function per each auth method that you use in your app.

   2. **Define custom API endpoints for each migration function** you implemented.

      With each data migration function below, we provided a relevant `api` declaration that you should add to your `main.wasp` file.

   3. **Run the data migration function(s)** on the local development database by calling the API endpoints you defined in the previous step.

      You can call the endpoint by visiting the URL in your browser, or by using a tool like `curl` or Postman.

      For example, if you defined the API endpoint at `/migrate-username-and-password`, you can call it by visiting `http://localhost:3001/migrate-username-and-password` in your browser.

      This should be it, you can now run `wasp db studio` again and verify that there is now relevant data in the new auth tables (`Auth` and `AuthIdentity`; `Session` should still be empty for now).

2. **Verify that the basic auth functionality works** by running `wasp start` and successfully signing up / logging in with each of the auth methods.

3. **Update your JS/TS code** to work correctly with the new auth.

You might want to use the new auth helper functions to get the `email` or `username` from a user object. For example, `user.username` might not work anymore for you, since the `username` obtained by the Username & Password auth method isn't stored on the `User` entity anymore (unless you are explicitly storing something into `user.username`, e.g. via `userSignupFields` for a social auth method like Github). Same goes for `email` from Email auth method.

Instead, you can now use `getUsername(user)` to get the username obtained from Username & Password auth method, or `getEmail(user)` to get the email obtained from Email auth method.

Read more about the helpers in the [Accessing User Data](../auth/entities#accessing-the-auth-fields) section.

1. Finally, **check that your app now fully works as it worked before**. If all the above steps were done correctly, everything should be working now.

   :::info Migrating a deployed app

   After successfully performing migration locally so far, and verifying that your app works as expected, it is time to also migrate our deployed app.

   Before migrating your production (deployed) app, we advise you to back up your production database in case something goes wrong. Also, besides testing it in development, it's good to test the migration in a staging environment if you have one.

   We will perform the production migration in 2 steps:

   - Deploying the new code to production (client and server).
   - Migrating the production database data.

   ---

   Between these two steps, so after successfully deploying the new code to production and before migrating the production database data, your app will not be working completely: new users will be able to sign up, but existing users won't be able to log in, and already logged in users will be logged out. Once you do the second step, migrating the production database data, it will all be back to normal. You will likely want to keep the time between the two steps as short as you can.

   ---

   - **First step: deploy the new code** (client and server), either via `wasp deploy` (i.e. `wasp deploy fly deploy`) or manually.

     Check our [Deployment docs](../deployment/intro.md) for more details.

   - **Second step: run the data migration functions** on the production database.

     You can do this by calling the API endpoints you defined in the previous step, just like you did locally. You can call the endpoint by visiting the URL in your browser, or by using a tool like `curl` or Postman.

     For example, if you defined the API endpoint at `/migrate-username-and-password`, you can call it by visiting `https://your-server-url.com/migrate-username-and-password` in your browser.

   Your deployed app should be working normally now, with the new auth system.
   :::

##### 2. Cleanup the Old Auth System

Your app should be working correctly and using new auth, but to finish the migration, we need to clean up the old auth system:

1. In `main.wasp` file, **delete auth-related fields from the `User` entity**, since with 0.12 they got moved to the internal Wasp entity `AuthIdentity`.

   - This means any fields that were required by Wasp for authentication, like `email`, `password`, `isEmailVerified`, `emailVerificationSentAt`, `passwordResetSentAt`, `username`, etc.
   - There are situations in which you might want to keep some of them, e.g. `email` and/or `username`, if they are still relevant for you due to your custom logic (e.g. you are populating them with `userSignupFields` upon social signup in order to have this info easily available on the `User` entity). Note that they won't be used by Wasp Auth anymore, they are here just for your business logic.

2. In `main.wasp` file, **remove the `externalAuthEntity` field from the `app.auth`** and also **remove the whole `SocialLogin` entity** if you used Google or GitHub auth.

3. **Delete the data migration function(s)** you implemented earlier (e.g. in `src/migrateToNewAuth.ts`) and also the corresponding API endpoints from the `main.wasp` file.

4. **Run `wasp db migrate-dev`** again to apply these changes and remove the redundant fields from the database.

:::info Migrating a deployed app

After doing the steps above successfully locally and making sure everything is working, it is time to push these changes to the deployed app again.

_Deploy the app again_, either via `wasp deploy` or manually. Check our [Deployment docs](../deployment/intro.md) for more details.

The database migrations will automatically run on successful deployment of the server and delete the now redundant auth-related `User` columns from the database.

Your app is now fully migrated to the new auth system.

:::

#### Next Steps

If you made it this far, you've completed all the necessary steps to get your
Wasp app working with Wasp 0.12.x. Nice work!

Finally, since Wasp no longer requires you to separate your client source files
(previously in `src/client`) from server source files (previously in
`src/server`), you are now free to reorganize your project however you think is best,
as long as you keep all the source files in the `src/` directory.

This section is optional, but if you didn't like the server/client
separation, now's the perfect time to change it.

For example, if your `src` dir looked like this:

```
src
│
├── client
│   ├── Dashboard.tsx
│   ├── Login.tsx
│   ├── MainPage.tsx
│   ├── Register.tsx
│   ├── Task.css
│   ├── TaskLisk.tsx
│   ├── Task.tsx
│   └── User.tsx
├── server
│   ├── taskActions.ts
│   ├── taskQueries.ts
│   ├── userActions.ts
│   └── userQueries.ts
└── shared
    └── utils.ts
```

you can now change it to a feature-based structure (which we recommend for any project that is not very small):

```
src
│
├── task
│   ├── actions.ts    -- former taskActions.ts
│   ├── queries.ts    -- former taskQueries.ts
│   ├── Task.css
│   ├── TaskLisk.tsx
│   └── Task.tsx
├── user
│   ├── actions.ts    -- former userActions.ts
│   ├── Dashboard.tsx
│   ├── Login.tsx
│   ├── queries.ts    -- former userQueries.ts
│   ├── Register.tsx
│   └── User.tsx
├── MainPage.tsx
└── utils.ts
```

### Appendix

#### Example Data Migration Functions

The migration functions provided below are written with the typical use cases in mind and you can use them as-is. If your setup requires additional logic, you can use them as a good starting point and modify them to your needs.

Note that all of the functions below are written to be idempotent, meaning that running a function multiple times can't hurt. This allows executing a function again in case only a part of the previous execution succeeded and also means that accidentally running it one time too much won't have any negative effects. **We recommend you keep your data migration functions idempotent**.

##### Username & Password

To successfully migrate the users using the Username & Password auth method, you will need to do two things:

1. Migrate the user data

<details>
  <summary>Username & Password data migration function</summary>

  ```wasp title="main.wasp"
  api migrateUsernameAndPassword {
    httpRoute: (GET, "/migrate-username-and-password"),
    fn: import { migrateUsernameAndPasswordHandler } from "@src/migrateToNewAuth",
    entities: []
  }
  ```

  ```ts title="src/migrateToNewAuth.ts"
  import { prisma } from "wasp/server";
  import { type ProviderName, type UsernameProviderData } from "wasp/server/auth";
  import { MigrateUsernameAndPassword } from "wasp/server/api";

  export const migrateUsernameAndPasswordHandler: MigrateUsernameAndPassword =
    async (_req, res) => {
      const result = await migrateUsernameAuth();

      res.status(200).json({ message: "Migrated users to the new auth", result });
    };

  async function migrateUsernameAuth(): Promise<{
    numUsersAlreadyMigrated: number;
    numUsersNotUsingThisAuthMethod: number;
    numUsersMigratedSuccessfully: number;
  }> {
    const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
      include: {
        auth: true,
      },
    });

    const result = {
      numUsersAlreadyMigrated: 0,
      numUsersNotUsingThisAuthMethod: 0,
      numUsersMigratedSuccessfully: 0,
    };

    for (const user of users) {
      if (user.auth) {
        result.numUsersAlreadyMigrated++;
        console.log("Skipping user (already migrated) with id:", user.id);
        continue;
      }

      if (!user.username || !user.password) {
        result.numUsersNotUsingThisAuthMethod++;
        console.log("Skipping user (not using username auth) with id:", user.id);
        continue;
      }

      const providerData: UsernameProviderData = {
        hashedPassword: user.password,
      };
      const providerName: ProviderName = "username";

      await prisma.auth.create({
        data: {
          identities: {
            create: {
              providerName,
              providerUserId: user.username.toLowerCase(),
              providerData: JSON.stringify(providerData),
            },
          },
          user: {
            connect: {
              id: user.id,
            },
          },
        },
      });
      result.numUsersMigratedSuccessfully++;
    }

    return result;
  }
  ```
</details>

2. Provide a way for users to migrate their password

   There is a **breaking change between the old and the new auth in the way the password is hashed**. This means that users will need to migrate their password after the migration, as the old password will no longer work.

   Since the only way users using username and password as a login method can verify their identity is by providing both their username and password (there is no email or any other info, unless you asked for it and stored it explicitly), we need to provide them a way to **exchange their old password for a new password**. One way to handle this is to inform them about the need to migrate their password (on the login page) and provide a custom page to migrate the password.

<details>
  <summary>
    Steps to create a custom page for migrating the password
  </summary>

  1. You will need to install the `secure-password` and `sodium-native` packages to use the old hashing algorithm:

  ```bash
  npm install secure-password@4.0.0 sodium-native@3.3.0 --save-exact
  ```

  Make sure to save the exact versions of the packages.

  2. Then you'll need to create a new page in your app where users can migrate their password. You can use the following code as a starting point:

  3. Finally, you will need to create a new operation in your app to handle the password migration. You can use the following code as a starting point:

  <Tabs groupId="js-ts">
    <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
      ```wasp title="main.wasp"
      action migratePassword {

      ```
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

      ```

##### Email

To successfully migrate the users using the Email auth method, you will need to do two things:

1. Migrate the user data

<details>
  <summary>Email data migration function</summary>

  ```wasp title="main.wasp"
  api migrateEmail {
    httpRoute: (GET, "/migrate-email"),
    fn: import { migrateEmailHandler } from "@src/migrateToNewAuth",
    entities: []
  }
  ```

  ```ts title="src/migrateToNewAuth.ts"
  import { prisma } from "wasp/server";
  import { type ProviderName, type EmailProviderData } from "wasp/server/auth";
  import { MigrateEmail } from "wasp/server/api";

  export const migrateEmailHandler: MigrateEmail =
    async (_req, res) => {
      const result = await migrateEmailAuth();

      res.status(200).json({ message: "Migrated users to the new auth", result });
    };

  async function migrateEmailAuth(): Promise<{
    numUsersAlreadyMigrated: number;
    numUsersNotUsingThisAuthMethod: number;
    numUsersMigratedSuccessfully: number;
  }> {
    const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
      include: {
        auth: true,
      },
    });

    const result = {
      numUsersAlreadyMigrated: 0,
      numUsersNotUsingThisAuthMethod: 0,
      numUsersMigratedSuccessfully: 0,
    };

    for (const user of users) {
      if (user.auth) {
        result.numUsersAlreadyMigrated++;
        console.log("Skipping user (already migrated) with id:", user.id);
        continue;
      }

      if (!user.email || !user.password) {
        result.numUsersNotUsingThisAuthMethod++;
        console.log("Skipping user (not using email auth) with id:", user.id);
        continue;
      }

      const providerData: EmailProviderData = {
        isEmailVerified: user.isEmailVerified,
        emailVerificationSentAt:
          user.emailVerificationSentAt?.toISOString() ?? null,
        passwordResetSentAt: user.passwordResetSentAt?.toISOString() ?? null,
        hashedPassword: user.password,
      };
      const providerName: ProviderName = "email";

      await prisma.auth.create({
        data: {
          identities: {
            create: {
              providerName,
              providerUserId: user.email,
              providerData: JSON.stringify(providerData),
            },
          },
          user: {
            connect: {
              id: user.id,
            },
          },
        },
      });
      result.numUsersMigratedSuccessfully++;
    }

    return result;
  }
  ```
</details>

2. Ask the users to reset their password

There is a **breaking change between the old and the new auth in the way the password is hashed**. This means that users will need to reset their password after the migration, as the old password will no longer work.

It would be best to notify your users about this change and put a notice on your login page to **request a password reset**.

##### Google & GitHub

<details>
  <summary>Google & GitHub data migration functions</summary>

  ```wasp title="main.wasp"
  api migrateGoogle {
    httpRoute: (GET, "/migrate-google"),
    fn: import { migrateGoogleHandler } from "@src/migrateToNewAuth",
    entities: []
  }

  api migrateGithub {
    httpRoute: (GET, "/migrate-github"),
    fn: import { migrateGithubHandler } from "@src/migrateToNewAuth",

      const result = await createSocialLoginMigration("github");

      res.status(200).json({ message: "Migrated users to the new auth", result });
    };

  async function createSocialLoginMigration(
    providerName: "google" | "github"
  ): Promise<{

        externalAuthAssociations: true,
      },
    });

    const result = {
      numUsersAlreadyMigrated: 0,
      numUsersNotUsingThisAuthMethod: 0,
      numUsersMigratedSuccessfully: 0,
    };

    for (const user of users) {
      if (user.auth) {
        result.numUsersAlreadyMigrated++;
        console.log("Skipping user (already migrated) with id:", user.id);
